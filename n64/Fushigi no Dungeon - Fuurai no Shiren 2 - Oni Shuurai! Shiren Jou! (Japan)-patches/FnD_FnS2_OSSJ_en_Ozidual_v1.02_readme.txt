Shiren 2: Oni Invasion! Shiren Castle!
Now in English!!!

Two and a half years in the making, SharkSnack and Ozidual are proud to present the English translation of Shiren 2: Oni Invasion! Shiren Castle! for the N64. 

Follow 10-year old Shiren and his companion Koppa as they work to protect the Village of Napus from a terrible enemy. Climb mountains, float down rivers, journey through dungeons and maybe find paradise. But be careful! One wrong move and you could be sent back to the beginning with nothing more than your companion Koppa. 

Shiren 2 is the 3rd game in the Mystery Dungeon series which began with Torneko's Great Adventure and includes such popular series as Pokemon Mystery Dungeon and Chocobo Mystery Dungeon. Like a simpler version of Dark Souls, you will die and lose items from time to time but you will continue to progress. As frustrating as that can be it is a very rewarding game and saving Napus Village is only the beginning. Later on there is a whole monster collecting/leveling system with over 160 monsters. Not too surprising since Creatures, Inc. (makers of Mother and Pokemon games) had a hand in developing Shiren 2.

If you get stuck at any point in the game, check out SharkSnack's newly created wiki for Shiren 2: https://sharksnack.github.io/shiren-2

Note: Shiren 2: Oni Invasion! Shiren Castle! for the N64 is a completely different game from Shiren DS2 for the DS (which is a remake of Shiren GB2 for the GameBoy).
