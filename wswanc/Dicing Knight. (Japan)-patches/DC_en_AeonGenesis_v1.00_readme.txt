1.About Dicing Knight.
----------------------
Dicing Knight, a homebrew Wonderwitch game, managed to
win a Best Homebrew contest and saw an extremely limited
release as a commercial game. It's absurdly fun, for such
a simple game. Each dungeon is randomly rearranged when
you enter it, as is typical for roguelikes. The gameplay,
atypical of roguelikes, is comprised of fast-paced action.
An explanation of the controls follows in section 6.

4.Known Issues

--The patch is largely untested, so one or two of the graphics
  might not display 100% correctly. I think they will, though.

Please report any other bugs, spelling errors, and
such on The Pantheon (http://donut.parodius.com/agtp)
Screenshots are preferred, as are savestates.

  an increased rate while the shield is out.
