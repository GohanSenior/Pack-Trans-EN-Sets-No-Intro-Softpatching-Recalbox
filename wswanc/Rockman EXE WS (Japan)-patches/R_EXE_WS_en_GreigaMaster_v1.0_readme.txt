Rockman EXE WS English Translation v1.0

______________
Introduction
______________

Rockman EXE WS is a sidecrolling platformer for the WonderSwan Color.
The game doesn't have much story, but it's loosely based on the
Anime. Some significant characters are missing. Regardless it's a
fun, short little game.
Translated, we called the game: MegaMan Battle Network WonderSwan.

Patching
______________

The patch is distributed in .ips format. Download LunarIPS and
use it to open the .ips file and patch your .wsc WonderSwan Color file.
For emulating the game, I suggest mednafen as it is a powerful,
multi-platform emulator which supports WonderSwan.
