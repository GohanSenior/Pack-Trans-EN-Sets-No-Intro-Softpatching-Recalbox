1.About Ys 5
------------
The last untranslated game in Nihon Falcom's venerated Ys series, Ys 5
is a bit of an odd duck. It marks the series's first foray into button-
based combat instead of ramming-based combat. It ends up feeling slower
than prior (and successive) entries in the series though, and was the
last Ys game produced for several years before Ys 6 refined the formula.
As such, the game is a bit of a black sheep in the series, but it is by
no means bad - just average when compared to its larger collection of
peers outside of Ys.

Quick ROM Info:
3.00 MB (24mbit LoROM) WITHOUT header. (*exactly* 3,145,728 bytes)
No header.

If using ZSNES, make sure that the patch has the same name as your ROM.
In other words, if your ROM is called "ys5.smc" make sure the patch
is "ys5.ips" okay? If you're using a Mac, a Mac IPS patcher is
available. Check the AGTP Links page. If you're using a copier, you
probably already know how to patch the ROM :) Be sure to apply the
patch to a clean copy of the ROM, and make sure your ROM DOES NOT
HAVE A HEADER!. If you right-click the ROM and select Properties, it
should read "3.00 MB (3,145,728 bytes)". TUSH will remove all
of your headers for you easily, and you can find it at
http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/608/

An easy way to tell if the game has a header or not is that if you
apply the patch and the game does not boot, your game very likely does
have a header.
