Amazing Spider-Man, The - Lethal Foes
2015 Ver 1.0 English Translation by kepeb


I am proud to present a working and complete SNES translation of the 1995 Super Famicom
title, which was only released in Japan, and is arguably the best Spider-man title for
the SNES. This is quite a rare cartridge, and one of the most requested remaining SNES
translations online. During this project I have gained a new found respect for the amount
of patience and dedication it takes to do this kind of thing. I hope you enjoy it...
