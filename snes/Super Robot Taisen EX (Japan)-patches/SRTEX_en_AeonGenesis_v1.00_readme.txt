1.About SRW EX
--------------
After the end of the Third Super Robot War, three people find themselves in
the mysterious subterranian world of La Gias. Masaki Ando is returning to
his second home, Lune Zoldak has been pulled into La Gias against her will,
and the disciples of the evil god Volkruss have brought Shu Shirakawa back
from the dead. Super Robot Wars EX follows their three stories concurrently,
detailing the civil unrest in La Gias that occurs both between SRW3 and SRW4,
and between the first and second half of SRW Gaiden: The Elemental Lords.
EX lets the player experience each story serially, making choices at their
intersections that will optionally affect playthroughs of the other chapters.
As an example, a decision made early in Masaki's scenario will determine
which of two battleships will serve as his squad's carrier; if clear data
is carried over into Lune's scenario, she will automatically get the
battleship he did not. Some scenarios, characters, and endings are only
accessible using this system.

As an aside, if you played The Elemental Lords and were curious about the
events discussed in the Memorial Day chapter, during the time skip between
parts 1 and 2, this is the La Gias segment of that recap.

EX's development has been full of fits and starts. The last big technical
problem was solved over the summer and its development surged forward;
a script check and edit happened over the next several months to make
sure that the text translation was solid. The result looks great; I'm
quite proud of what we accomplished.

5.Application Instructions
--------------------------
Quick ROM Info:
1.50 MB (12mbit LoROM) WITHOUT header. (*exactly* 1,572,864 bytes)
No header.

If using ZSNES, make sure that the patch has the same name as your ROM.
In other words, if your ROM is called "srwg.smc" make sure the patch
is "srwex.ips" okay? If you're using a Mac, a Mac IPS patcher is
available. Check the AGTP Links page. If you're using a copier, you
probably already know how to patch the ROM :) Be sure to apply the
patch to a clean copy of the ROM, and make sure your ROM DOES NOT
HAVE A HEADER!. If you right-click the ROM and select Properties, it
should read "1.50MB (1,572,864 bytes)". TUSH will remove all
of your headers for you easily, and you can find it at
http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/608/

An easy way to tell if the game has a header or not is that if you
apply the patch and the game does not boot, your game very likely does
have a header.

6.Translation Notes
-------------------
So it turns out that "Zoldak" is actually a real Polish surname; given that
Bian is supposed to be Polish and Lune is supposed to be Polish-American,
we've updated the name for the SRW EX release. Other SRWs will have their
patches updated to reflect the name change as well.

------------------
7.Optional Patches
------------------
Included with the translation is one optional patch, and an additional
"undo" patch which will remove the patch's effects from your ROM should you
decide you don't like it. The patch is entirely standalone and does not
require the translation, so if for instance you decide you want Music
Persistence in your Japanese copy of the game, you can apply that one patch
and be on your way.

MUSIC PERSISTENCE
Super Robot War titles are strategy games, characterized by units moving
around a map and attacking one another in special animated sequences, during
which music plays from the player's (or boss's/Elzam's) unit's TV show,
movie, OVA, etc. It's usually a theme song from the show's opening sequence,
but since Masoukishin does not contain any licensed properties, they're all
various theme songs written for the original characters that appear in the
game.

In later SRW titles, the unit's theme music will continue to play
after the animated sequence ends and the game returns you to the map. This
tends to make the games feel more exciting, as the music is generally
designed to get the viewer invested in the show. Older SRW titles, however,
would stop the theme music as soon as the animated sequence ends, and would
start the map music over from the beginning. As a direct result, you never
heard much of the robot's themes OR the map music unless you deliberately
stuck around and waited to listen.

The Music Persistence patch changes the music behavior in SRWEX to be more
like the later games in the series. Once an attack sequence begins and a
theme song starts playing, the theme song will continue to play until either
the turn ends or a unit from a different series takes part in a battle
sequence.
