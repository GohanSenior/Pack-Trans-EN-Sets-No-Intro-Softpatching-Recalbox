1. Patch History
================================================================================
v0.90 - 2/6/2007
- Replay system completely translated.
- Game over graphic translated.
- Title screen *not* translated. See below for details.
- Idiocy removed.
- Let's forget the previous versions ever existed.

2. About Umihara Kawase
================================================================================
Umihara Kawase is a platform game that was only officially released in Japan
and enjoyed a sequel on the PlayStation. The title is derived from a Japanese
cooking idiom meaning "sea fish are fat in the belly, river fish are fat in
the back".

The game is pretty simple. You control a girl with a rubber fishing line
which you can use to attack and catch most of the various enemies in the
game. However, its main use is to navigate through the levels. You can hook
onto any solid surface, and mastering swinging from surface to surface is the
key to getting far in this game.

The game comes with an option to watch a replay of your progress once you
lose. This feature is suprisingly sophisticated; you can store replays in
several files and save them to the game's memory. It's this feature that
has been translated.

True, in this day and age, this feature has been completely superceded by
the great ease of making gameplay clips and sharing with them others on
the Internet, but the reason this translation was made was to bring attention
to a rather unique and enjoyable game.

3. Controls
================================================================================
D-Pad : Move/Reel in line (up)/Loosen line (down)
A     : Jump
B     : Throw fishing line
X     : Jump
Y     : Throw fishing line
L     : Scroll screen left
R     : Scroll screen left
Start : Pause
Select: Not used.

Operating the Replay System:
First, you need something to replay. For the sake of this demonstration,
play the game, lose all your lives, and return the main menu.
Go into the replay menu, and select the option "Save".
The save menu will list 10 files, representing the 10 lives you used.
They're named FIELDxx, where xx is the number of the FIELD you died
at. Anyway, pick a file and save it. Now, you can replay it.
Leave the Save menu, and you can either Replay, Rename or Delete
the file. I think it's pretty self explanatory from there.

4. Issues
================================================================================
None known at time of release.

5. What doesn't this patch do?
================================================================================
The title screen is left in the original Japanese. I think it looks better
that way, but if anyone feels like producing a *good* English version, I'll
gladly incorporate it into this translation.

6. Why, after all this time, are you rereleasing such a minor translation?
================================================================================
Umihara Kawase was my very first contribution to the translation scene, and
it's nostalgic for me. However, I also produced this translation when I was
a stupid high schooler, and it ended up being that I couldn't think back on
it without cringing in embarassment. One thing that particularly bothered me
was that I had altered the TNN logo graphic at the start of the game to a
short message, and another was the really crappy hand-written "The End!" on
the Game Over screen. I decided I couldn't put this translation on my current
site without fixing this, and I thought maybe I could at least get this out
there so that eventually only a few people will know that I was a dumb high
school kid once.

7. Patching Note
================================================================================
Considering that not that many people will be playing this compared to titles
like Tales of Phantasia or Shin Megami Tensei, I don't think I have to be very
verbose here.
You should know, however, that this patch was made for a ROM /WITHOUT/ a header.
The size of an Umihara Kawase ROM without a header is 1,048,576 bytes.

Special thanks to:
Kent Keltner, who brought this game to my attention.

Akimaru, who helped me with some difficult parts of the translation as
I didn't actually speak Japanese when the translation was first made.

B. Reminder
