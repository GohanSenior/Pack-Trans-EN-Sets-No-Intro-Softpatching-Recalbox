0.PLEASE NOTE
-------------
YOU _MUST_ BE OPERATING UNDER A HIRES VIEW MODE FOR
MUCH OF THE TEXT TO DISPLAY CORRECTLY!! Rudra uses
hires display for -ALL- of its text, and while the
normal dialogue font will display in any view mode,
it will appear distorted. The other fonts may become
completely unreadable if a hires display mode is not
enabled!! You -must- be using a 512x448 display mode
or higher, if you're using ZSNES, and all special
graphics enhancing functions MUST be disabled!

------------------------------
1.About Treasure of the Rudras
------------------------------
Treasure of the Rudras was released in 1996 on the
Super Famicom console by Squaresoft. It is a fairly
standard role-playing game, if one with some incredibly
pretty graphics. Its major selling point, however, was
a system of magic that allowed the player to actually
enter words (any words!) into the game and have it
build a spell effect based on what the player typed in.
This system has some incredible depth to it - it's
easy to learn, but you won't become a master until
you've really played quite a bit of the game and learned
all of its intricacies and what each of the "base" words
provided by various people (and monsters!) actually do.

RULE #1 FOR PLAYING RUDRA: IT IS _NOT_ FINAL FANTASY 3/6!
It is graphically very similar to FF3/6, but it is VERY
MUCH NOT THE SAME GAME. Go into the game expecting to play
FF3/6, and you will not only be likely let down, you will
also likely get your ass handed to you. The game is
DIFFICULT and requires intense mastery of its inherent
spell system if you want to stand a snowball's chance in
hell against some of the bosses.

Please note that this patch is a hybrid of languages:
The French dialogue was used, however everything else was
retranslated from the original Japanese to ensure the highest
possible level of accuracy [especially due to some of the
squishing done to the various lists such as the enemy,
location, and item lists in the French patch.] The "F" in
the version number indicates that this patch's dialogue was
based off of the French version's. 

As this Translation was made possible by the French patch,
there should be two patches available in this zip. rnhj.ips
should be applied to a Japanese language ROM, rnhf.ips should
be applied to the French RC2 ROM. More on this later.

2.Patch History
---------------
Work started on Rudra in August of 2002, shortly after
the French group Terminus Traduction released their patch
for the game. I'd always wanted to work on the title, so
I snapped it up as quickly as I could. It stalled for a
number of months, as NinjaC64 - the main translator for
the dialogue - disappeared due to familial issues for
a while. He resurfaced in December and then disappeared
again, but I decided that I was going to excersize my own
knowledge of the French language. I completed about 25%
of the script on my own, as self-study preparation for an
exam I had to take in March (I passed it and earned 12
college credits, the equivalent of four semesters worth
of classes, in French. Haw.) As I was getting sick of it
in late February, NinjaC64 reappeared, and we both made
a valiant effort to get it out for April 19th. He
succeeded in getting the script done, but it was quite
rough, and I'd burnt out on the technical issues a few
days before, so it sat idle for another month or so,
after which I picked it up on spurts of motivation and
time. This version was released on July 4, 2003.

I was not satisfied with this, however. The introductory
legend was very ugly, there were a few small coding issues
with the mantra system, and the writing on the script was,
while certainly in English, was generally very sub-par on
the whole. Steps have been taken to correct these - the
entire script saw a full rewrite thanks to M of Returner
Games (you may be familiar with his writing for Front Mission:
Gun Hazard) and the intro's been redone. The assembly's
been fixed, and there's a few small cosmetic hacks in place
as well. I've also installed a fully variable-width font
for the main dialogues; on the whole, this new version is
much improved from its prior incarnation.

June 11, 2015 - Version 2.1 release.
--Fixes an issue where casting a spell in battle negates
  or sends negative the caster's Strength and Agility buffs.
--Fixes cursor memory issue on pages 5-8.
--Patch no longer requires a header; patching instructions
  in this readme updated to reflect.

July 4, 2006 - Version 2.0 release.
-Adds new variable-width font, with autocenter where
 appropriate
-Full script rewrite
-Enemy names extended by an extra two letters
-Opening legend redone
-Auto-enscription on pages 3 or 4 of mantra bank fixed
-Item descriptions rewritten and enhanced

July 5, 2003 - Beta 2 release.
--Fixes saving and loading for mantras 17-32. Oops.
--Also fixes some missing linebreaks and such.

July 4, 2003 - Initial version 0.99 Release

3.Features
----------
Since Rudra is easily my biggest accomplishment yet,
I thought I should let you, the reader, in on some of
what the translated ROM image, after application of
the IPS patch, features.

----------------------
IN THE INITIAL VERSION
----------------------
-740 kilobytes of English script!
-Item names expanded from 8 letters max to 13!
-Monster names expanded from 8 letters max to 10!
-Spell name sizes DOUBLED, six letters to twelve!
-A fully hacked-and-translated Mantra magic system!
-Location names expanded from 12 characters to 16!
-Battle menu expanded to fit six letter commands in!
-Battle data squished over, menus expanded and moved to
 accomodate 10 letter enemy names!
-Character names expanded from 6 letters to 8!
-Enemy attack names expanded from 8 letters to 16!
-Elemental affinity highlighting reprogrammed to work
 with horizontal words instead of vertical icons!
-ALL areas of the subscreen, shop menus, and save/load
 menus expanded to fit in the new long character names,
 item names, spell names, etc.
-Items-per-menu reduced to 4 during battle, pages
 doubled from 3 pages to 6!
-Spells-per-menu to 4 during battle, pages doubled from
 4 pages to 8!
-32x32 font shrunk down to 16x32 so "textual" spell effects
 don't look hugely blocky!
-Area name display font width halved!
-Combat attack display font width halved!
-Backgroundless text display font width halved!

---------------------------
The new version includes...
---------------------------
-A completely redone opening sequence!
-Full variable-width support for the main dialogue font,
 with support for dynamic centering of text and automatic
 indentation! The font remains in hires, so none of the
 original luster of a 512-pixel wide text window is lost,
 so long as your emulator supports hires!
-A fully rewritten and polished script!
-Battle screen hacked a bit to allow two MORE letters in
 enemy monster names!

5.Known Issues
--------------
If you're on page 5, 6, 7, or 8 in a battle menu and cursor
memory is enabled, the cursor will revert to page 1, 2, 3, or 4.
I haven't figured out a way to fix this yet.

Please report any other bugs, spelling errors, and
such on The Pantheon (http://donut.parodius.com/agtp)
Screenshots are preferred, as are savestates.

6.Application Instructions
--------------------------
Quick ROM Info:
4.00 MB (32mbit HiROM) WITHOUT header. (*exactly* 4,194,304 bytes)
No header.

If using ZSNES, make sure that the patch has the same name as your ROM.
In other words, if your ROM is called "rudra.smc" make sure the patch
is "rudra.ips" okay? If you're using a Mac, a Mac IPS patcher is
available. Check the AGTP Links page. If you're using a copier, you
probably already know how to patch the ROM :) Be sure to apply the
patch to a clean copy of the ROM, and make sure your ROM DOES NOT
HAVE A HEADER!. If you right-click the ROM and select Properties, it
should read "4.00 MB (4,194,304 bytes)". TUSH will remove all
of your headers for you easily, and you can find it at
http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/608/

An easy way to tell if the game has a header or not is that if you
apply the patch and the game does not boot, your game very likely does
have a header.
