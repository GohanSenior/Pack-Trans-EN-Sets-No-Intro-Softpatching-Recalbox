Instructions
============
The patch file included in this archive is in the IPS format.
It is meant to be applied to an image file of Kyuuyaku Megami Tensei
that has a CRC32 checksum value of: C8D286C9.
If patched to a file with a different checksum,
various unsupported bugs may occur during play.

If you are using an emulator that supports "soft-patching", which allows
a file to be modified in memory during run-time but leaves the original
file intact, please follow the instructions that should be included with
that emulator in order to do so.

In order to apply the patch directly, you will need an IPS file patcher.
I have personally used Lunar IPS and find that it works very well.
Upon executing Lunar IPS:
 - Select "Apply IPS Patch"
 - In the dialog window, select the "kmt_v1.ips" file and click "Open"
 - Select the Kyuuyaku Megami Tensei image file and click "Open"
If everything was successful, it should display a window saying
"The file was successfully patched!"

If using another IPS file patcher, please follow the instructions
included with it.
