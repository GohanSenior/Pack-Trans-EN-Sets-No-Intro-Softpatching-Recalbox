1.About Danzarb
-----------------
Danzarb is a simple little RPG produced by Pandora Box, Gainax, and
Yutaka. It features a battle system halfway between Phantasy Star and
Final Fantasy, giant robot dragons, a new gameplay twist for each
mission, and a story that, while largely cliche, impresses greatly
by the end of the game.

---------------
2.Patch History
---------------
The Danzarb project initially started in October of the Year 2000, but
went rather slowly until late December, when it really started to pick
up.

Quick ROM Info:
1.00MB (8mbit HiROM), WITHOUT Header (1,048,576 bytes), DEINTERLEAVED

If using ZSNES, make sure that the patch has the same name as your ROM.
In other words, if your ROM is called "danzarb.smc" make sure the patch
is "danzarb.ips" okay? If you're using a Mac, a Mac IPS patcher is
available. Check the AGTP Links page. If you're using a copier, you
probably already know how to patch the ROM :) Be sure to apply the
patch to a clean copy of the ROM, and make sure your ROM DOES NOT HAVE
A HEADER!. If you right-click the ROM and select Properties, it
should read "Size: 1.00 MB (1,048,576 bytes)".

***FURTHER*** Make sure that the ROM is DE-INTERLEAVED! Run your ROM
through NSRT; it will remove headers and de-interleave you ROM for you
should it require any of this.

6.Troubleshooting
-----------------
--If the game does not run at all, read the above section on
  application instructions (specifically on header removal
  and deinterleaving.)
  Make sure your ROM is not read-only when you toy with it.
  Also make sure that if you previously hard-patched the ROM and
  the game crashes as described, you will need to re-apply the
  patch a clean, Japanese original ROM.

--Note that the first time you run the game, it does dump you
  directly into the prologue! The only time the title screen
  actually appears is between the prologue and Mission 1. This
  is NOT a bug!
