1.0 Information


1.1 ****Patch Information****

    This patch when hard patched correctly will result in a VALID checksum.

    This patch was created for use on an original ROM that has:

    * NO header
    * CRC32: 6E030B96
    * No-Intro (http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/1002/) identified as
        Tenshi no Uta - Shiroki Tsubasa no Inori (Japan), Version 1.0 

    The 'TransPatch.exe' custom patching application can be used to ensure 
    you have the correct ROM and patch, and apply the patch to headered or 
    non-headered ROMs automatically. This is the recommended way to apply 
    the patch for novice patchers.

    The patcher should work on Win95/98/ME/2000/XP/Vista/7/8/10, as well as 
    Linux under Wine. It should be self explanatory to use. You will be 
    asked for your ROM file and your IPS patch file. The program will alert 
    you if any errors are found or upon a successful patching job. 

    An xDelta format patch is also provided for reliable patching in all other
    cases. xDelta patchers are available on all platforms. Popular choices are:

2.0 The Project


2.1 History of the Project

    Boy am I glad this project is finally done! I was really getting scared 
    there. This project was in high danger of being abandoned. The history 
    of this project is really one of how not to do a project! It was done 
    piecemeal across many years, with shifting attention, shifting available 
    people, missteps, side projects, backtracking, and more! That's just how 
    it goes though sometimes with spare time projects involving multiple 
    people with differing lives and availability. A last ditch effort these 
    past two years finally pulled everything together and brought it up to 
    polished standards. Had this last effort failed, it would have been 
    abandoned. Don't let this wishy-washy story fool you. This project 
    turned out to be very good and some of my best work in the end! 
    
    The project was originally announced in December of 2003. Progress in 
    early 2004 was off to a very swift start completing basic dialog 
    hacking. However, progress was quickly slowed when attention shifted to 
    Emerald Dragon. 2005 saw further time competition with other projects 
    along with difficulties of being able to complete a full script dump. 
    The script was hard to dump due to a difficult to decipher game 
    scritping engine (embedded event code and text). It was easy to get most 
    of the text, but very hard to get all of it. There was always new 
    discoveries of different text calls missed in previous dumps that would 
    plague the project. Each time this occurred, things would need to be 
    reworked, translated, and delayed.

    The non-dialog text wasn't much better. Many of the menus had isolated, 
    hard coded strings. This means they have absolutely no organizational 
    structure, and aren't even grouped together. With no organizational 
    structure, you can't easily find and extract them (let alone all at 
    once, together). The game also typically used various macros and hard 
    coded pointers to embedded text. It even used hard coded sub-tables 
    within tables. I used reverse pointer lookups, heuristics (pattern 
    searching), and every other trick I could think of to find it all, but 
    still missing strings would pop up here and there. In the end, you 
    simply didn't know of some strings existence until you saw it in-game. 
    These types of recurring issues led to constant starts and stops with 
    both myself and the translator. Working like this killed any type of 
    momentum every time. 
    
    Serious progress resumed in 2008 on Tenshi No Uta with much menu 
    hacking being accomplished, including a partial VWF conversion. However, 
    progress was killed once more upon discovering many different text 
    routines being used on various menu screens for printing. Sometimes 
    different text engines were even used to print the same text! I have to 
    assume this game was worked on simultaneously by different people who 
    all wrote their own text engines for whatever pieces they were working 
    on. This would require a universal VWF hack approach. 2008 ended with 
    first attempt at an SNES universal VWF hack for all the routines, but it 
    was a bit kludgy and too slow. Like a broken record, once again progress 
    was killed when 2009 and 2010 saw interruptions with medical issues. It 
    became apparent with all the new text formats discovered that new 
    tooling was necessary to handle it all. Finally, a working universal 
    VWF and new tooling was completed in 2012, however attention was turned 
    to finishing Glory of Heracles IV (using all of the same tools and 
    advancements) until 2015. 
    
    After so much starting and stopping, the project wandered far away. The 
    project was in danger of being abandoned. A final attempt was made to 
    make a serious push to enlist some extra help, get everybody together at 
    the same time, and finally finish the project. We all spent time coming 
    back up to speed, went over the entire project, polished it up, and 
    finally got the whole thing done! 
            
    At least it all worked out in the end and we have a another completed 
    translation! I probably did more than any other person on the planet 
    would do for this game, so please enjoy my continued passion and 
    dedication to this hobby and community. You can now have the opportunity 
    to play Song of the Angel in English! Thank you to all who have given me 
    words of support, all who have lent a helping hand to the project, and 
    the fans of TransCorp and our community. As always, take it, love it, 
    cherish it! 

2.2 Words from the Translator (by Liana)

    Tenshi no Uta represents my commitment to studying Japanese, and for 
    that reason I'm proud that this translation is complete. I started 
    learning Japanese in college, and after I graduated, I recognized how 
    much work mastering the language would actually be. I was at a 
    crossroads: continue studying, sinking tremendous amounts of effort into 
    Japanese, or leave it and spend my time on something else? I chose to 
    keep studying, and one thing I did to motivate myself was to download 
    this game and start to try translating it. At the time it was a 
    laborious effort, and I must have learned thousands of basic words from 
    my work on it. But I'd always been curious about the Super Famicom RPGs 
    that had never been translated and released on the SNES, and it was a 
    delight to work my way through this unabashedly sentimental, beautifully 
    written little game. 

    There was a period of several years between when I finished the bulk of 
    the translation and when Nightcrawler was able to devote his attention 
    to the project. I had thought it was unlikely to ever be finished, so I 
    was delighted by the prospect of seeing it done and also being able to 
    revise my old script, as I'd studied intensively and improved my 
    Japanese skill in the past few years. However, I was in a very different 
    phase of my life, as I was now a mother and dealing with post-partum 
    depression. It took time to check my old work and translate every bit of 
    the script, and I was deeply grateful for Nightcrawler's patience with 
    me! 

    Tenshi no Uta is a deeply thoughtful, unique game that was clearly 
    designed and written with great love. I appreciate its gentle sense of 
    humor, its focus on the relationships between the characters and the 
    epic scale of its story. It's an honor for me to release it, all these 
    years later, and I hope you'll delight in the characters and their 
    struggles as I do. 
   
       
3.0 About the Game


    Song of the Angel was a game released in 1994 by Telnet Japan and had 
    many of the developers who would eventually form the famous 'Wolf Team' 
    that brought us Tales of Phantasia and Star Ocean! Many musical tracks 
    were also done by the same composer too. Play the game, and the music 
    and atmosphere will be very familiar to fans of the aforementioned 
    games. Even though the game is rather obscure, its developers certainly 
    are not! 
    
    The graphics are colorful, crisp, and get the general point across. 
    There is also some beautiful hand drawn artwork during cut scenes, which 
    really adds to the game. The character portraits are also a nice touch 
    to bring the tiny character sprites to life. The music is top notch and 
    with a good variety of tracks, a few of which you will undoubtedly find 
    yourself humming along with or being stuck in your head. The soundtrack 
    is amongst some the best of any 1994 SFC games I have heard. I do miss 
    the era where game music was composed for melody and emotion rather than 
    simply being atmospheric. 
    
    The gameplay is the typical 1994 RPG fighting engine, with a few 
    additions. The most notable addition is the Parley system. This system 
    allows you to parley with monsters using several languages in order to 
    befriend or negotiate outcomes. Options include gaining gold, purchasing 
    special items, gaining experience, raising friendship points, and more! 
    There are day/night cycles that effect dialog as well as changing wares 
    in certain shops. You will walk, teleport, sail on a boat, and fly on an 
    ancient ark by the time your adventure concludes. 
    
    Tenshi No Uta is a love story at its core. A young man named Rayard 
    meets a traveling circus performer and songstress named Callana. They 
    fall in love early, but part ways due to Callana's traveling 
    lifestyle. After many days of misery, Rayard pulls himself together and 
    sets out to tell Callana how he really feels. Thus, the real journey 
    begins! This game has angels, demons, and even Satan himself! The story 
    and writing are the stand-outs of this game. If you appreciate substance 
    over style, you'll enjoy this game for it's charming core!

5.0 What you will find in this patch:


    It's complete now, so you SHOULD find everything 100% translated! 

    If you find any bugs, please report them at the TransCorp message board.

    Easter Egg:

    Unfortunately, due to how many years this project took, I did not do my 
    previous tradition of adding myself to the game. You would be looking in 
    vein. Maybe next time. :) 

    
6.0 Known Issues:


    None with the patch, however the original game is slightly buggy. I 
    fixed as many original game bugs as I could that were detrimental to 
    gameplay and the intended behavior of the original code was clear enough 
    for a reasonable quick fix. 
    
    Two notable fixed bugs were the inventory eating Rurimon Bell glitch and 
    the level checkpoint level 99 glitch, which are documented on some 
    Japanese sites. Some original game bugs remain such as minor visual 
    pixel glitches during area or battle transitions with a full party. 

    Please try and see if the issue occurs in the original game 
    before reporting any patch bugs. It would be greatly appreciated.
