DO NOT USE ZSNES WITH THIS GAME. As of this writing
(9/20/02) ZSNES has some nasty flicker issues in
three of the stages (the Master, Rising, and Speigel
Gundam stages.) This is -NOT- caused by the patch,
it's an emulation issue. DO _NOT_ BUG ME ABOUT IT!

----------------
1.About G Gundam
----------------
G Gundam is a mediocre fighting game for the Super
Famicom/Super NES console and it's based on an anime
of the same name. There isn't much else to say about
it.

---------------
2.Patch History
---------------
I don't even remember when I started working on this
game, only that I started it for font size modification
practice. About two weeks ago, I fixed the last of the
issues with the font, and the result is as you see here.

September 20, 2002 - Initial version 1.00 Release

Special Thanks
Alexander Beetle deserves an extra mention here, because
his script is a very good read. He took extra time to
polish it up and make it worth your time, and his excellent
writing saves the game from total mediocrity.

4.1 Known Issues with Emulators
-------------------------------
The following issues are emulator issues and are NOT
caused by the patch:

Issue: Nasty flicker problem in Master, Rising, Speigel
Gundam stages.
This is a problem with ZSNES. I do not know if it's
fixed in SNES9X.

5.Application Instructions
--------------------------
If using SNES9X, make sure that the patch has the same name as your ROM.
In other words, if your ROM is called "ggundam.smc" make sure the patch
is "ggundam.ips" okay? If you're using a Mac, a Mac IPS patcher is
available. Check the AGTP Links page. If you're using a copier, you
probably already know how to patch the ROM :) Be sure to apply the
patch to a clean copy of the ROM, and make sure your ROM DOES NOT HAVE
a header. If you right-click the ROM and select Properties, it
should read "Size: 2.00MB (2,097,152 bytes)". SNESTool will remove all
of your headers for you easily, and you can find it at
http://rpgd.emulationworld.com
In the utilities section, click on the IPS Tools link.
