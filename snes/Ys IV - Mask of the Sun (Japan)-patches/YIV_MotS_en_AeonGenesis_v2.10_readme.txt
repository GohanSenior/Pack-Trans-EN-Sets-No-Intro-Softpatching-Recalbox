0.Before You Begin
------------------
Do _NOT_ apply the new patch on top of the old one! Apply to a fresh,
clean Japanese copy of the game. I cannot be held responsible for
issues stemming from patching over the old translation!

1.About Ys IV
-------------
Ys IV is an Action-RPG/Adventure game by Nihon Falcom and published by
Tonkinhouse.

---------------
2.Patch History
---------------
The Ys IV project started in October of 2000, and progressed quickly
towards the final goal. There were slow points revolving around the
reformatting of text and message windows (unlike Monstania which
automatically generates windows, Ys IV has control codes.) Once that
was out of the way, the project progressed fairly quickly to the end.

After the initial release it quickly became apparent that the old
patch was inadequate. The script was flat, and the font routine did
not function properly on actual hardware. In this release, these issues
have been fixed - the font routine should work fine on a real Super NES
system, and the script has been given a marvelous facelift by Deuce,
the local Ys junkie.

November 28, 2013 - Version 2.10 release
--In-game terminology standardized against Memories of Celceta
--Fixed a few instance of too-long strings corrupting the game background

February 3, 2007 - Version 2.00 release
--Fixes font print on real hardware
--Complete script rewrite

March 31, 2000 - Initial version 0.99 release

4.Known Issues
--------------
--The font did not print properly on the "special" background,
  so I just disabled it. It was ugly as sin, anyway.

Please report any other bugs, spelling errors, and
such on The Pantheon (http://donut.parodius.com/agtp)
Screenshots are preferred, as are (ZSNES format) savestates.

--------------------------
6.Application Instructions
--------------------------
If using ZSNES, make sure that the patch has the same name as your ROM.
In other words, if your ROM is called "ys4.smc" make sure the patch
is "ys4.ips" okay? If you're using a Mac, a Mac IPS patcher is
available. Check the AGTP Links page. If you're using a copier, you
probably already know how to patch the ROM :) Be sure to apply the
patch to a clean copy of the ROM, and make sure your ROM DOES NOT HAVE
A HEADER!. If you right-click the ROM and select Properties, it
should read "Size: 1.50 MB (1,572,864 bytes)". SNESTool will remove all
of your headers for you easily, and you can find it at
http://www.romhacking.net
In the Utilities section, simply search for snestool.

An easy way to tell if the game has a header or not is that if you
apply the patch and the game does not boot, your game very likely does
not have a header.

-----------------
6.Troubleshooting
-----------------
--If the game does not run at all, read the above section on
  application instructions (specifically on header removal.)
  Make sure your ROM is not read-only when you remove its header.
  Also make sure that if you previously hard-patched the ROM and
  the game crashes as described, you will need to re-apply the
  patch a clean, Japanese original ROM.

7.How to Play
-------------
DEFAULT CONTROLS:

ARROW KEYS - Move Adol
A BUTTON - Accept a choice.
B BUTTON - Cancel out of a menu.
Y BUTTON - Use an item.
X BUTTON - Cast magic, when standing still.
L/R BUTTON - Not used.

To talk to a villager, just walk into them and conversation will begin.

COMBAT

Combat in Ys IV is not like combat in most action-RPGs. Be sure you're
viewing this document in a fixed-width font before reading the next
section.

In order to do damage to an enemy, you have to run through it. But if
you ram it head-on, you'll take damage instead (unless you're really
strong.) Instead, run into the enemy half a "block" to the left or
right of it.
EXAMPLES
Let us say that "EE" is the enemy, and "AA" is Adol.

GOOD:

 EE
AA

 EE
  AA

BAD:

 EE
 AA

It's kinda hard to describe... but it's really neat once you get used
to it. Fighting bosses is pretty much the same, except that the bosses
won't hurt you unless you actually stand still on top of them. So long
as you're moving and you don't get hit by any of the boss' attacks,
you'll be fine.
