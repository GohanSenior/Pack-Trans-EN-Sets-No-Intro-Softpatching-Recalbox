1. Patch History
================================================================================
 
V.100 - 04/25/09

-Inital Release

2. Super Ultra Baseball 2
================================================================================

Culture Brain’s Ultra Baseball (Baseball Simulator in the US) series is a unique 
baseball statistical simulator. Players have the option to create their own Team, 
choose manager personalities, uniforms and stats. Additionally players have the 
unique option of using the Ultra League where players have higher stats and super 
Ultra powers!

Super Ultra Baseball 2 is the fourth game released in the Ultra Baseball Series. 
The first two games were released in the US under the titles of “Baseball 
Simulator 1,000”. Culture Brain planned to release this game as “Super Baseball 
Simulator 1,000 2” but later canceled the release.

Ultra Baseball Series:

-Ultra Baseball: released in 1989 for the NES as "Baseball Simulator 1,000".

-Super Ultra Baseball: released in 1991 for the SNES as "Super Baseball Simulator 1,000".

-Ultra Baseball Jitsumeiban: released in 1992 for the SNES in Japan only. This is 
basically Super Ultra Baseball w/ real names (Jitsumeiban means Real Names Version). 
The graphics and sound are slightly better, and there is a new pennant option but 
this obviously uses the same engine. 

-Super Ultra Baseball 2: released in 1994 for the SNES in Japan only. Culture Brain 
planned to release this title as "Super Baseball Simulator 1,000 2" but canceled shortly 
after. This game uses a new engine and sports more features.

-Ultra Baseball Jitsumeiban 2: Same engine as SUBB2, but with real players and some 
additional features. Most of this game has been translated into English by Tuffy da Bubba
and is currently being revised and completed.  

-Ultra Baseball Jitsumeiban 3: 1995, new engine, completely players even have numbers on
their jerseys.

-Pro Yakyuu Star: 1996, same engine as UBBJ3 but cartoon mode only and no ultra powers.
