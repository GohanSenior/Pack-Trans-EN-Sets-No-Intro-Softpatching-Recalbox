1.About Laplace's Demon
-----------------------
Laplace's Demon is a horror RPG with a Lovecraftian bent.
Set in the fictional town of Newcam, Massachusetts in 1924,
the player and several paranormal investigators look into
some disturbing rumors surrounding a mansion on the outskirts
of town.

2.Patch History
---------------
Laplace's Demon was originally released in 2001. There was
a very strong (and ill-conceived) push to get it out on
Halloween back then, and the resultant patch was terribly
buggy; battle menus didn't display right, status menus didn't
display right, lots of item names had been chopped down to fit
in available space, battle narrative didn't display in the
correct order, and the writing was in desperate need of an edit.

I eventually pulled the patch voluntarily, as it really did not
meet my own quality standards. I continued to work on it on and
off, fixing the combat narrative, expanding menus, and adding
multi-line item names. I got some help with the font display
issues and started work on the narrative myself, but eventually
passed it off to Wes Falls, a developer who I follow on Twitter.
Lots of issues kept cropping up during testing, several of
which turned out to be in the original game. It's not very
well put together, but we did the best we could with what we
had.

4.Known Issues
--------------
-- Somehow, you can end up with a "Nothing" item in your inventory.
   This can cause the Tools menu in combat to look weird. Sorting
   fixes it. Unsure whether this is a bug in the original game
   or not.
-- Character names longer than six letters in slots 2 and 4 will
   occasionally overwrite the "HP" indicator of the characters
   in slots 3 and 5 when they're targeted in combat. The HP
   indicator will reset when the next character or monster
   takes its turn.

Please report any other bugs, spelling errors, and such on
on The Pantheon (http://agtp.romhack.net/pantheon/)
Screenshots are preferred, as are SRAM saves.

5.Application Instructions
--------------------------
Quick ROM Info:
2.00 MB (16mbit LoROM) WITHOUT header. (*exactly* 2,097,152 bytes)
No header.

If using ZSNES, make sure that the patch has the same name as your ROM.
In other words, if your ROM is called "laplace.smc" make sure the patch
is "laplace.ips" okay? If you're using a Mac, a Mac IPS patcher is
available. Check the AGTP Links page. If you're using a copier, you
probably already know how to patch the ROM :) Be sure to apply the
patch to a clean copy of the ROM, and make sure your ROM DOES NOT
HAVE A HEADER!. If you right-click the ROM and select Properties, it
should read "2.00MB (2,097,152 bytes)". TUSH will remove all
of your headers for you easily, and you can find it at
http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/608/

An easy way to tell if the game has a header or not is that if you
apply the patch and the game does not boot, your game very likely does
have a header.
