1.Hiouden ~ Legend of the Scarlet King
--------------------------------------
Hiouden's a fast-paced strategy game that takes place in real-time. I
refer to it as such so as people don't confuse it with the more popular
resource-management RTS games out there, like Warcraft or Command and
Conquer, because it's definitely not like those at all. It's got a fair
amount of story, is tough as nails, was developed by Wolfteam and has
music by Motoi Sakuraba if that's your thing.

2.Patch History
---------------
God, this project's old. All I can tell you folks is that it sat around
collecting dust for a while, that I eventually got the necessary hacks
done, played around with the menu some, and waited for playtesters. It's
been a very long haul, but it's also been a very long day, and I really
don't have the patience to sit down and force myself to remember every
little detail of Hiouden's history. Sorry, folks.

October 12, 2004 - Initial version 1.00 Release

4.Known Issues
--------------

--The DTE doesn't always function 100% correctly, and it will on very
rare occasions leave out a letter. This should not affect your enjoyment
of the game at all.

--If a character's level exceeds 255, the game crashes. I'm fairly
convinced that this happens in the Japanese version as well, so it's not
my problem.

There are no other known issues. If you find any, please post
about them on The Pantheon (http://donut.parodius.com/agtp)

5.Application Instructions

Quick ROM Info:
1.50B (12mbit LoROM), WITHOUT Header (1,572,864 bytes).

If using ZSNES, make sure that the patch has the same name as your ROM.
In other words, if your ROM is called "hiouden.smc" make sure the patch
is "hiouden.ips" okay? If you're using a Mac, a Mac IPS patcher is
available. Check the AGTP Links page. If you're using a copier, you
probably already know how to patch the ROM :) Be sure to apply the
patch to a clean copy of the ROM, and make sure your ROM DOES NOT HAVE
A HEADER!. If you right-click the ROM and select Properties, it
should read "Size: 1.50 MB (1,572,864 bytes)". SNESTool can remove
your headers for you easily, and you can find it at
http://rpgd.emulationworld.com
In the utilities section, click on the IPS Tools link.

An easy way to tell if the game has a header or not is that if you do
the above and the game does not run, it probably has a header. Use
SNESTool to remove the header from a clean Japanese ROM and try again.
And don't whine about SNESTool not working in Windows XP, it works
fine for me and I'm running on XP Pro.

-----------------
6.Troubleshooting
-----------------
--If the game does not run at all, read the above section on
  application instructions (specifically on header removal.)
  Make sure your ROM is not read-only when you add its header.
  Also make sure that if you previously hard-patched the ROM and
  the game crashes as described, you will need to re-apply the
  patch a clean, Japanese original ROM.
