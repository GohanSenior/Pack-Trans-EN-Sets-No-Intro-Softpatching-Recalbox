0.Before You Begin
------------------
There seem to be a lot of issues with this game and emulators. Sometimes,
when going to Nanba through the sewers the event where the garage door
bursts open and people come through won't happen. There are graphical
glitches with the ground bleeding into the bottom window at times, an
invisible train will sometimes go by (stay off the tracks folks!) and
there was some glitchiness in the ending. As far as I'm aware, I did not
cause these issues.

-----------------------------
1.About Shodai Nekketsu Kouha
-----------------------------
Shodai Nekketsu Kouha (hereafter "Kunio") is an interesting fusion of
the RPG and Beatemup genres of gameplay. You wander the streets of Osaka,
getting into fights (randomly, if you don't start them yourself), beating
people up, gaining items and experience, and levelling up. If you've
played River City Ransom, you'll feel right at home - same series, really.
Money has been replaced by random drops and experience, though; you can
buy stuff from vending machines, but they take the generic "prepaid cash
card" currency, at an exchange rate of one cash card for one item. You
can also spend cash cards on crane games, slot machines, and fortune-
telling machines, once you find a game center.

2.Patch History
---------------
I don't even remember much about this. It started a few years ago, the
script was translated pretty quickly, but technical issues with the lower
window (mostly related to the menus) held things back for a while. Intrepid
hackers g8z et al. helped out with that, though. The script format was
annoying, and it needed some polishing, done by yours truly. It's not perfect
but it's a hell of a lot better than it used to be, and given the extreme
sprayscatter of variables in the text, I think it came out rather well.

4.Known Issues
--------------
--Very infrequently, a random letter may show up on the right edge of your
  menu or item list.
--When handing the letter to Masaki in Koushien, the text isn't as... nice
  as I'd like, but given the way it's stored, it's the best I can do.

Please report any other bugs, spelling errors, and
such on The Pantheon (http://donut.parodius.com/agtp)
Screenshots are preferred, as are (ZSNES format) savestates.

6.Application Instructions
--------------------------
If using ZSNES, make sure that the patch has the same name as your ROM.
In other words, if your ROM is called "shodai.smc" make sure the patch
is "shodai.ips" okay? If you're using a Mac, a Mac IPS patcher is
available. Check the AGTP Links page. If you're using a copier, you
probably already know how to patch the ROM :) Be sure to apply the
patch to a clean copy of the ROM, and make sure your ROM DOES NOT HAVE
A HEADER!. If you right-click the ROM and select Properties, it
should read "Size: 1.00 MB (1,048,576 bytes)". SNESTool will remove all
of your headers for you easily, and you can find it at
http://www.romhacking.net
In the Utilities section, simply search for snestool.

An easy way to tell if the game has a header or not is that if you
apply the patch and the game does not boot, your game very likely does
not have a header.

-----------------
6.Troubleshooting
-----------------
--If the game does not run at all, read the above section on
  application instructions (specifically on header removal.)
  Make sure your ROM is not read-only when you remove its header.
