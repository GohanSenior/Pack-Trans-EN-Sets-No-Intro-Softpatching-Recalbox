Shockman Zero (aka 'Kaizou Choujin Shubibinman Zero' or 'Kaizou Choujin Schbibinman Zero' in Japan) was first released in 1997 for the Satellaview addon for the Super Famicom. It is a side-scrolling beat-'em-up developed by Masaya. In 2017 Columbus Circle gave the game a Japan-only limited release on a physical Super Famicom cartridge. This translation-patch is for the 2017 version of the game. The patch translates all the texts to english. If all worked fine, the internal checksum should be correct. 

We hope you have as much fun playing the game as we had localising it ðŸ™‚
