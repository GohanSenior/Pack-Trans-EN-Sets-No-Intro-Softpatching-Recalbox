1.About SMT if...
-----------------
The third and final Shin Megami Tensei title released on the SNES,
if... is a bit of a sidestory. Rather than dealing with the war
between a biblical heaven and hell, it follows a group of students
whose high school gets pulled into the Expanse by angry teenager.
It features four possible partners; three explore worlds based on
the seven deadly sins, each with unique bits to their stories,
while the fourth features ane entirely separate series of dungeons
and follows a different game in its own right.

In addition to the recruitment and fusion mechanics present in the
older SMT titles, if... features greatly expanded demon conversation
options, and each the human characeters get killed, they get a
new "guardian" demon, granting them parameter changes and spells.

If using ZSNES, make sure that the patch has the same name as your ROM.
In other words, if your ROM is called "smtif.smc" make sure the patch
is "smtif.ips" okay? If you're using a Mac, a Mac IPS patcher is
available. Check the AGTP Links page. If you're using a copier, you
probably already know how to patch the ROM :) Be sure to apply the
patch to a clean copy of the ROM, and make sure your ROM DOES NOT
HAVE A HEADER!. If you right-click the ROM and select Properties, it
should read "2.00MB (2,097,152 bytes)". TUSH will remove all
of your headers for you easily, and you can find it at
http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/608/

An easy way to tell if the game has a header or not is that if you
apply the patch and the game does not boot, your game very likely does
have a header.

6.Translation Notes
-------------------

There are a few places where the translation deliberately deviates from
official Atlus nomenclature. These were considered carefully and are
noted below.

Fairy->Fey
--This was done primarily to differentiate between the standard image
  of a fairy (see: the Pixie demon) as opposed to the wider Celtic
  sphere of mythology encompassing characters such as Cu Chulainn.
  We feel that "Fey" better encapsulates the concept being communicated.

Girimehkala -> Girimekhala
--Spelling source:
  The Dhammayut Order in the United States of America (2013).
    A Chanting Guide: Pali Passages with English Translations. p130

7.Bugs in the Original Game
---------------------------
The party obtains the Ring of Kindness at the end of the Sloth dungeon.
If you re-enter the room where the Ring of Kindness was found, the game
will tell you that it was where you found the Ring of Tolerance. We
have confirmed that this occurs in the original game.
