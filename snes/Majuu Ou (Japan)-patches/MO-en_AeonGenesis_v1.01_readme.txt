1.About King of Demons
----------------------
King of Demons is a fun little sidescroller game with
a very dark, gothic atmosphere and an equally depressing
storyling. The wife and daughter of Abel, the main
character, have disappeared along with his best friend,
Bayer, and Abel heads to the Demon World to try to get
them back. Upon arrival, he learns that Bayer has sold
his soul, and that his wife was sacrificed to ressurect
the King of Demons. His daughter is still alive,
somewhere within the Demon World...

Abel can, initially, shoot at enemies, charge a -strong-
punch attack, roll forward (hold down and press A), do
a double jump, and kick downwards (hold down during a jump
then press attack.) After beating a boss, however, you'll
have the option of morphing into one of three different
forms, each with their own unique attacks and control
styles. There's a fairly large plot twist at the end,
too...

2.Patch History
---------------
I have -no- idea when I started this, quite possibly as
far back as May '01. Akujin translated all of the text
except for the "happy" ending, which I didn't find until
a day or two ago, and the credits. Much of it was beyond
my ability when I first started it. I went back to it
in August '02 or so, and tried again, and failed again.
Doh. Some nastiness with the way the window worked killed
it that time. I just picked it up again this past Tuesday,
and it's Thursday evening as I write this, with everything
complete. It's about goddamn time.

August 19, 2005 - Version 1.01 Release
-Changes a mistyped word in the good ending.
 Makes much more sense this way.

February 14, 2002 - Initial version 1.00 Release

4.Known Issues with the Patch
-----------------------------
-The names in the credits might not be correct. Kanji-based name
romanization is a shot in the dark at best, even for a native
speaker....

This patch has not been officially tested, although I did go
through it yesterday and double-checked it, so it -should- be
okay. If you find a problem, though, please leave a screenshot
in The Pantheon, my forum (http://donut.parodius.com/agtp).

5.Application Instructions
--------------------------
If using ZSNES, make sure that the patch has the same name as your ROM.
In other words, if your ROM is called "majyuuou.smc" make sure the patch
is "majyuuou.ips" okay? If you're using a Mac, a Mac IPS patcher is
available. Check the AGTP Links page. If you're using a copier, you
probably already know how to patch the ROM :) Be sure to apply the
patch to a clean copy of the ROM, and make sure your **ROM DOES NOT HAVE**
a header. If you right-click the ROM and select Properties, it
should read "1.50 MB (1,572,864 bytes)". SNESTool can remove any headers
for you easily, and you can find it at
http://rpgd.emulationworld.com
In the utilities section, click on the IPS Tools link.

-----------------
6.Troubleshooting
-----------------
--If the game does not run at all, read the above section on
  application instructions (specifically on header addition.)
  Make sure your ROM is not read-only when you remove its header.
  Also make sure that if you previously hard-patched the ROM and
  the game crashes as described, you will need to re-apply the
  patch a clean, Japanese original ROM.
