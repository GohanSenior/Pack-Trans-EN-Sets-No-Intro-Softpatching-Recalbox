Comments from DDStranslation, the hacker:

I hadn't heard of this game until Tom mentioned it, but I am glad to have played through it, experienced it, and help bring it to English speaking players.

It was a short and simple project to work on between other large projects. And it was also nice to work on an adventure game. I still managed to learn and try out new things while programming on it as well.

Tom and FlashPV did such great work with it, and I would definitely love to work with them again.

Comments from Tom, the translator:

The phrasing and spellings in this patch may differ from existing English translations of Kenji Miyazawa's work. I didn't consult any of them while working on this translation. I just translated everything in the game as I saw fit.

This translation project was a nice break from the usual RPG stuff.

It's always a pleasure to work with DDStranslation and FlashPV. I'm looking forward to working with them on another project in the future.

Comments from FlashPV, the pixel artist:

With this game, Tom found another obscure one so it'll be a new discovery for many people (including me).

As always with DDS, you can expect top-notch hacking. Tom has done a great translation too, and I was in charge of a few graphic changes.

I think we'll work together again and I hope you'll like our work. Thanks for reading this.
