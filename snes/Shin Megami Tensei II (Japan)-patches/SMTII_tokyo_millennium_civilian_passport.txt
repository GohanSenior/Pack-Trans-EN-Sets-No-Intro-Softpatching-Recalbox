To Whom It May Concern,

    Please find the enclosed "Tokyo Millennium" Civilian Passport. Review the
 articles contained within it, as careful study of them will greatly increase
 your chances of survival in Millennium. Do note, however, that this passport
 is a forgery, and will not pass for the real thing if a Temple Knight requests
 it of you. If you are caught with it, you will be executed. You have been
 warned. Thank you, and enjoy your stay in "Tokyo Millennium"!
 
                                                      Sincerely,
                                                      Gideon Zhi

_______________________________________________________________________________


The once great city known as "Tokyo" was beset by an onslaught of catastrophes,
but still survives today as "Tokyo Millennium."

....Tokyo Millennium is a city governed by the Mesian Church, as a place to
assemble the faithful and preach their message of the impending arrival of the
Messiah. It was originally built as an attempt to bring about the Thousand Year
Kingdom in reality, but neither the Messiah nor God has appeared yet to
actualize it. With the authoritarian nature of its government, striking class
distinctions between the citizens of the town slowly formed:

1) The reigning area of "Millennium" that controls the others is nicknamed the
   "Center."
2) The elite members of the "Center" that serve as the city's police force are
   called the "Temple Knights."
3) Those that are allowed to live in the "Center," the First-Class Citizens.
4) Those that are allowed to own "Arm Terminals," the Second-Class Citizens.
5) Everyone else that is just allowed to live in "Millennium," the General
   Citizens.

This story begins in the most populous district of "Tokyo Millennium," the
"Valhalla Area." The residents of Valhalla enthusiastically embrace the
life-or-death battles that take place there in the Colloseum. Recently, a new
fighter, "Hawk" appeared there and rose to greatness overnight. The masses
witnessed his great fighting prowess in the Colloseum, and after watching his
string of victories became even more wild about the duels. But nobody knew
anything about him--who he was or where he came from. Not even Hawk himself...




HISTORY OF TOKYO:
-----------------

199X:
-----
* The Great Destruction of Tokyo
  Thorman presses the button to launch nuclear-warhead-tipped ICBMs at Tokyo.
  Global nuclear holocaust ensues.

203X:
-----
* The Great Tokyo Flood
  After the rebuilding of Tokyo, a tectonic plate movement of massive
  proportions causes the ocean to rush into Tokyo and decimate the area
  around it. Even after the waters receded, the suburbs of Tokyo remained
  submerged.

* Establishment of a Communal Cooperative Society
  After the destruction of the Cathedral, a free society and government is
  established, where anyone, both Mesian and Gaian alike, are welcomed warmly.

204X:
-----
* Rise of the Mesian Church
  Through political machinations, the Mesian Church takes over the government
  and converts it to a theocracy.

* Gaian Revolt
  Angry and opposed to the Mesian rise to power, several groups of Gaians start
  riots, but they are quickly quelled by the Temple Knights.

205X:
-----
* Completion of the Center
  Using a huge amount of funding, a massive structure is built on the former
  site of the Cathedral and named the "Center." The plan to create a municipal
  government called "Millennium" is announced.

* Demonoids developed
  In order to ensure a source of labor, artifical life forms called "Demonoids"
  are developed.

206X:
-----
* Millennium nearly completed
  Facilities designed to accomodate the people like Valhalla and the Factory
  (a production/industrial area) are designed and nearly complete.
  Entertainment facilities like the Casino are also built.

* Environmental Contamination
  Through global warming, radioactive contamination, and the deterioration of
  the ozone layer, most of the world outside of Millennium is rendered
  uninhabitable. Large numbers of people from around the world flock to
  Millennium, as its environment is entirely self-contained.

* Temple Knights become Special Police Forces
  After putting an end to several Gaian demonstrations and revolts, the Temple
  Knights are evaluated by the Center and are promoted to Elite status. They
  are declared the official police force of the city. Their increase in power
  tightens the control the Center has on the rest of the city.

20XX:
-----
 And the Messiah is born...

                           ARM TERMINAL & CONTROLLER
              -----------------------------------------------

ARM TERMINAL:
-------------
Second-Class Millenium Citizens are permitted to own an Arm Terminal. Arm
Terminals are equipped with many functions that will prove useful to a resident
of Millenium. Also, with an Arm Terminal, you can use many facilities around
the city specifically designed to interface with it.

NOTE: Use of Arm Terminals by resident aliens or non-citizens is strictly
prohibited.

CONTROLLER:
-----------
Arm terminals distributed by the Center can all be controlled remotely by the
Controller. The Controller is equipped with one motion key and 8 buttons. They
function as follows:

A Button: Change to Command Mode, Confirm Command, Scroll Messages
B Button: Cancel Command, Scroll Messages
X Button: Auto-Recover (See attached section)
Y Button: All-Cancel (Cancel Command Mode completely)
R Button: Installed command ("Read My Note--Steven" is scrawled here)
L Button: Auto-Mapping (One-touch display)
Motion Key: Move, select command, scroll messages.
(The above is the default control scheme, and can be changed with the
Configuration program installed in all Arm Terminals)


                                USING TERMINALS
              -----------------------------------------------

Terminals are operated by the TOKYO Millenium Terminal Service. (TMTS)
Citizens that own Arm Terminals may use any TMTS terminal.
Please refrain from using any functions other than Transport (Teleportation
between Terminals), and Record (Recording progress) unless authorized to do
so.
When you enter a terminal, it will send a signal to your arm terminal, which
will display "Transport" and "Record."
Use your Arm Terminal and Controller as normal to select your choice.

TRANSPORT: You can use this function to instantly transport to any terminal
           of your choice. Only Terminals that you have visited and registered
           in your Arm Terminal will be available as destinations.
RECORD: Using this function, you can record your progress into Millenium's
        public databanks. Each citizen is permitted use of up to two files.
        When recording, choose the file you wish to use. You can restart from
        any point recorded in your files.


(There is a note taped into your passport here)
_______________________________________________________________________________                            
                              ABOUT YOUR NAME

 Greetings. Right now you are in a state of amnesia and cannot remember anything
 from the past. You may find this inconvenient, but believe me when I tell you
 that it is for your own good.
 Your memory loss is not entirely permanent, and as time passes you should
 remember bits and pieces of it. Your consciousness will most likely drift away
 on a "rhythm" and you will remember the names of people that are close to you.
 Be prepared for this to happen.
 When it is time for you to remember the names of those close to you, use your
 controller to select the letters of their names and pres the A button. By
 pressing up and down you can scroll through the available letters. If you make
 a mistake you can press B to cancel what you have done.
 When you have picked up to 6 letters, move your cursor to [END]. Then you will
 be able to remember the true name of the person you are recalling.

I only pray that you will be able to survive that long...

                                                             Mekata

                              ABOUT YOUR GOGGLES
              -----------------------------------------------

When you received your Arm Terminal, it came with a pair of goggles. These are
connected to your Arm Terminal by two wires, and display your Arm Terminal's
information through a video feed.

Moon Phase:      Displays the current phase of the moon. Demon activity and
                 strength varies according to moon phase, so be aware of it.
Direction/Floor: Displays your current floor and the direction that you are
                 facing. Use this to get your bearings.
MAG:             Your current level of Magnetite. Its magnetic strength will
                 be picked up by your arm terminal and recorded. Your Arm
                 Terminal can run on extremely low levels of Magnetite, so you
                 will probably not need to worry about this level.
Money:           Your current level of money. The normal currency is & (Makka)
E.A.:            Enemy Appearance Indicator. By detecting residual levels of
                 Magnetite in the area, your Arm Terminal will display the
                 level of danger you are in from enemy (in other words, demon)
                 attack. While the gauge's color changes from blue to green, you
                 are safe, but if the color turns from yellow to red, you are at
                 reasonably high risk of meeting demons. In the case that your
                 E.A. turns red, you should leave the immediate area at once.
Members:         This displays the current status of the party of people
                 travelling with you. Your members' Names, HP, MP and condition
                 will be displayed here.
Commands:        By pressing the A button onyour controller, you can enter
                 Arm Terminal Command Mode. The default commands of your
                 Terminal are displayed here.

2D FIELD DISPLAY:
----------------
 
Outside, an overhead display of the area will be fed to your goggles. In
addition, moon phase and E.A. are also displayed. If you wish to return to a
normal view, simply enter Command Mode and the overhead map will turn itself
off automatically. As soon as you leave Command Mode, the overhead map will
return.


                          ARM TERMINAL COMMAND MODE
              -----------------------------------------------

If you wish to use the advanced functions of your Arm Terminal, you can do so
by entering Command Mode. Press the A button on your Controller to do so. Use
the control key on your controller to select a command, and use the A button
to choose one.

If you are in a building or underground, your Arm Terminal will keep a record
of all the places that you have been. Using this program, you can create an
overhead display map of these recroded areas. The Auto-Mapping program only
stores data in two dimensions, so it will only display one floor at a time.
In addition, it will display your current position, and any exits, stairways,
elevators, terminals, churches, or other facilities you may have been in.
You can set the map to either "Fixed" or "Free" in the Configuration menu.

                          ARM TERMINAL COMBAT MODE
              -----------------------------------------------

In the off chance that any demons get into Millenium, the Temple Knights
will dispose of them. However, there may be times where especially crafty
demons escape from the Temple Knights and go into hiding within the city.
You must not let your guard down. It is the responsibility of all citizens
of Millenium to be prepared at all times to defend themselves should the
need arise. Your Arm Terminal's Combat Mode will help you should you come
into conflict with a demon. Whenever a demon comes near, your Arm Terminal
will switch to Combat Mode, and any necessary commands will be displayed in
your goggles.

[FIGHT]
Fight the demons that are facing you. When you pick this command, either the
following sets of commands will appear:

SWORD, GUN, COMP, ITEM, DEFEND: Fighter commands
SWORD, GUN, MAGIC, ITEM, DEFEND: Non-fighter commands

SWORD: Attack with your melee weapon
GUN: Attack with your gun
COMP: Use your computer

[ESCAPE]
Break away from combat. However, depending on your or your enemies' "Speed" or
"Luck", you might fail.

[AUTO]
Turn on Autobattle. Use normal attacks over and over. If you set it to "Repeat"
on the Config menu, the actions you took in the previous fight will repeat. If
you hold down the B button during autobattle, it will stop. Once it does,
return to normal command entry.

          TO THE PERSON I HAVE GIVEN THE DEMON SUMMONING PROGRAM TO:
          ----------------------------------------------------------

This program has been installed into your Arm Terminal's memory, so you can use
it with your [COMP] command easily. The menu choices in your [COMP] function
will have increased, as you will probably notice.

Summon Minion:
--------------
This is the command you'll use to summon any demons you've bound to your will.
Summoning demons takes Makka. Also, keeping demons manifested requires a
constant supply of MAG, so keep an eye on how much you have left.

Return Minion:
--------------
This command returns a summoned minion to your Stock.

Dismiss Minion:
---------------
This command dismisses a minion from your Stock.
Dismissed minions are gone for good. You'll need to either recruit them again
or create them via fusion, so be careful.

With the [Magic] Command, you can have your minions cast spells, or cast spells
on your minions.

With the [Item] Command, you can use items on your minions as well.

If you look at your [Status], you can also see that a "Minions" item has been
added below your NEXT value. This shows your current stock of minions and the
maximum number of minions you can possibly have in total. In addition, you can
use Status to see the status of any of your minions.

When looking at a demon's status, you will note the additional "CP" value in
its stats. This indicates how much MAG it will consume as you walk with it
summoned. In addition, the demon's alignment will be displayed.

With the [Change] Command, you can change your minions' marching order.

With this program, when any demon confronts you, you can use the [TALK] command
to talk to it. If you negotiate will, it may join you as a minion.

The conversations you have with the demons will be translated into a language
you can understand and displayed in your goggles.

Of course, if you wish to fight any demons you meet up with, you can have your
minions participate in the battle as well. The demons you summon will loyally
obey your orders.

[ATTACK] will have your minion attack normally.

If your minion possesses a special physical or magical attack, then you can
have them use it by selecting the [EXTRA] command. However, Special physical
attacks take HP to use, and special magic attacks take MP to use, so make a
note of this.

With the [RETURN] command, you can return a minion to your computer's Stock.

As indicated above, the program I gave you is completely compatible with your
Arm Terminal and will work seamlessly with it. Use it without worry. I look
forward to seeing you again.
                                    STEVEN

P.S.

Later, I think I'll give you my Devil Analyze program. With this program, you
can analyze the status of any demon you've ever fought or summoned, in and out
of battle. I've set it up so you can access it automatically with the R button
of your controller, so it should be useful. Right now it's in the final stages
of debugging.

                        GUIDE TO MILLENNIUM'S FACILITIES
                        --------------------------------

There are many facilities in Milennium for the convenience of its citizens.

TERMINALS:
----------
Here you can travel throughout Milennium or record your travels. Please refer to
the earlier section on rules and regulations regarding their use.

MESIAN CHURCHES:
----------------
Here you can be cured or healed. The churches are all subsidized by the taxes of
the citizens of Millenium, so you can use them for relatively low cost.

REPAIR GARAGES:
---------------
These stores are run by healers authorized by the Center. As they are not
operated by Millennium, their fees are somewhat high.

VIRTUAL BATTLERS:
-----------------
Here you can train yourself and gain battle experience by fighting in a safe,
virtual environment.

APPRAISAL STORES:
-----------------
In these stores, you can have the details of any of your items identified. In
case you have something but do not know its function, you can have it checked
out here before you use it.

FORTUNE TELLER:
---------------
The Fortune Tellers are authorized by the center to fortell your future in
these stores. If you do not know where to go, you should visit them and have
your fortune told.

BARS:
-----
The many bars throughout the city are here to provide citizens with a place to
drink and talk. People come in and out frequently, so if you want to pick up
new information, this is a good place to do it. Stop by every so often.

DISCO:
------
Like the bars, the discos in Millennium operate under authorization of the
Center.

CASINOS:
-------
The Casinos are authorized to operate by the Center, but as many citizens have
been driven to bankruptcy here, whether or not their permits will be renewed
are currently under consideration by the central government. Either way, take
care not to spend too much of your money.

GAIAN TEMPLES:
--------------
These are heathen temples that are outlawed. Should you find one, immediately
contact the Center and let them know.


                             RULES OF THE CASINO
                          -------------------------

By exchanging your Makka for Coins at the Cashier, you can play the games in
the Casino. Once you accumulate more coins, you can exchange them at the
Cashier for items.


SUPER 27:
---------
1 Play costs 1 coin.

Super 27 has three reels, and if three of the same symbol matches up on the
center line, it counts as a win.

The R button starts the game. If after the reels stop spinning the 3 symbols
don't line up, you can choose to hold up to 2 of them and play again. The left
reel can be held with the Y button, the center with the B button, and the right
with the A button. Once you've picked the reels to hold, press the R button to
play again. If you win, you can choose whether or not to keep your winnings or
to play the bonus game. Press up to pick the Bonus Game, Down to pick Take
Score, and press A to make your decision. The L button ends the game.

One play of the bonus game costs 5 Coins out of your winnings from the main
game. The R button starts the game. If three symbols match up in any combination
on the three reels--vertically, horizontally, diagonally--it counts as a win.
If you win, you can either press down to pick Take Score, or continue to play
until your winnings run out. Also, if you win 1000 coins, the game will
automatically stop.


LUCKY SYMBOL:
-------------
1 Play costs 1 Coin.

Lucky Symbol has four Reels, and if three or four of the same symbol line up on
the center line, it counts as a win.

The R button starts the game. 3 or 4 of the same symbol on the center line
counts as a win. If you get 3 of the same symbol, they don't have to be all
adjacent to one another. If on the window the numbers 1-3 appear, the sum of
the numbers will give you various bonuses.

12: 100 Coins
11: 20 Coins
10: 10 Coins
9: 5 Coins
8-7: Lucky Symbol--At this point, the symbols on the center line will become
     "Lucky Symbols," and the next time you get a win with them your winnings
     will be multiplied by 2 to 5.
6: Double--Your winnings will be doubled
4-5: Hold: You can hold up to 3 of the reels. From the left, use the X, Y, B,
     and A buttons to hold the reels. If you get a Hold and a win at the same
     time, you can use this function to win multiple times in a row.
3: Raise--The value of the Lucky Symbols will be raised. They start at 2x, then
   are raised to 3x, 4x, and finally 5x for each time you get this.
0-2: Nothing.

L button ends the game.


JOKERS & STARS:
---------------
1 Play costs 1-8 Coins

Jokers & Stars uses 9 Reels, and if three of the same symbols line up
vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, it counts as a win. If large numbers
of the same symbol appear that also counts as a win.

You can bet anywhere from 1 to 8 coins. Pressing the A button increases your
bet, and as your bet increases, so do the number of lines that can count toward
a win. You can reduce your bets with the B button. R button starts the game. If
more than 4 stars appear, you get to replay--press the R button again. Depending
on the number of stars, the content of the replay changes:

9 Stars: Win 200 Coins
8 Stars: Corner Joker--The four corners reels will become Jokers for the next
         play.
7 Stars: Cross Joker--Using the center reel as a "cross", the top, bottom,
         left, and right reels will become Jokers for the next play
6 Stars: Center Joker--The center reel will become a Joker for the next play.
         Jokers are wild and can count as any of the other symbols.
5 Stars: Seven Hold--All "7"s will be held for the replay.
4 Stars: Star Hold--All the Star symbols will be held for the replay.

If 4 or more of the same symbol appear in a single play, you will earn Coins
based on the type of symbol and how much you bet initially. The L button ends
the game.


BACCARAT:
---------
1 Play costs 1-100 Coins

In Baccarat, you bet on whether the BANKER or the PLAYER will win. You don't
bet on the cards, rather you try and guess who will win each match.

At first, you can bet whether the BANKER or the PLAYER will win, or if it will
be a TIE. However, you cannot bet on both the BANKER and the PLAYER at the same
time. (You can, however, bet on one of them and a TIE at the same time) Pick
someone to bet on--the A button bets 1 coin, the X button bets 10 coins. The B
button will reduce your bets. Once you've placed your bets, start the game with
the R button.

For the Card values, Ace counts as 1, and 10 through King all count as 0.
Whichever player has a value closer to 9 wins. (10 counts as zero) At first,
2 cards are dealt to each player, and one is shown. With the R button, you can
turn over the other card. If the two cards are 5 or below, the player will hit
and another card will be drawn. 6 or above means the player will Stand. If the
value is 8 or 9 that's a "Natural" and neither player will drawn a card--both
players will play with two cards alone.

The Banker will decided whether to hit or stand based on the Players cards, so
he has a slightly better chance of winning. Betting on a Banker win gets you
1.95x your bet, and betting on a Player win gets you 2x your bet. If you bet
on a tie and win, you'll get 9x your bet. If there is a tie and you bet on
either the Banker or the Player you'll get your bet back.

RESULT displays the results of the game, so you can consult it when making
your bet. Blue means the Banker won, Red indicates the Player won, and the
middle number shows the value they won with. L button ends the game. Also, all
fractions of a Coin when calculating wins are discarded.


KENO:
-----
1 Play costs 1-100 Coins.

In Keno, 16 numbers will be chosen from a list of 64, and you bet on which ones
will be chosen.

If you press A when No. SEL is selected, a cursor will appear on the number
board. Use the controller to move the cursor to a number you think will be
picked, and press the A button to choose it. You can pick up to 16 numbers,
and bet up to 100 Coins.

BET allows you to bet Coins. A button adds one coin, and the X button adds 10
coins to your bet, up to 100 Coins.

RESULT shows the results of the last 16 plays. Ranging from Blue (low) to Red
(high) it displays the frequency with which each number has been picked.

ERASE clears all the numbers that you picked before.

After a single play, the numbers you picked will remain. You can to continue
to play using those numbers. If you want to to change any of the numbers, you
can pick No. SEL and cancel numbers you picked with the B button, and rechoose
them. If you want to rechoose them all, pick ERASE, and then pick new numbers
with No. SEL.

Once you've picked your numbers and placed your bet, you can start the game
with the R button. Depending on the number of numbers you picked correctly,
the amount of Coins you win will increase.

L button ends the game.


BIG & SMALL:
------------
1 Play costs 10 Coins.

In Big & Small, numbers from 0-9 will be chosen. 5 and above is BIG, and 4 and
below is SMALL. You bet on whether you think the number chosen will be BIG or
SMALL.

First, with the controller, you can pick whether you think the next number will
be BIG or SMALL.

If you win, then you can use the R button to "DOUBLE CHALLENGE" or the L button
to "TAKE SCORE." If you Take Score then you'll collect your winnings.

With "Double Challenge," you can play double-or-nothing games to increase your
winnings greatly. The more times you win, the greater number of Coins you'll
gain, and you can win good items as well. If you lose at any time during a
Double Challenge, you'll lose all your winnings.

RESULT displays the results of the game so far. Take a look at it before
placing your bets. Blue indicates Small, Red indicates Big.

L button ends the game.


CODE BREAKER:
-------------
1 Play costs 1 Metal Card.

In Code Breaker, you try to deduce the hidden number of 3-5 digits, based on
the hints you'll get.

Code Breaker is located in places other than the Casino. R button starts the
game. With the controller you can pick numbers for each of the digits of the
secret number. Once you've picked numbers for all the digits, press the A
button to confirm your choice.

JUDGE displays how close you were to getting the right answer. H is a Hit. It
means you got the right number for a digit, and it's in the right place as
well. B is a Blow. That means you guessed a number correctly, but it's in the
wrong place.

HINT displays hints as to whether or not each number is in a certain spot or
not. X means that number is not in that column. O means that that number might
be in that Column. A double O means that number is definitely in that column.

If you guess the number within 8 tries, you will win an item.

L button ends the game.

LIGHT/LAW
---------
SHINREI: 
The faces of YHVH, the One God of the Judeo-Christian tradition. One
intrinsically without form.
DAITENSHI:
The Daitenshi are the top-ranking angels in the Hebrew god YHVH's army. They
are like a Law version of the Hakaishin. They command all of the lower-ranking
angels.
REICHO: 
Reicho are bird gods, and usually serve as messengers or mounts of more
powerful deities. They are still quite powerful in their own right.
AMATSUKAMI: 
The Gods of Heaven from Japanese tradition, the guardian deities of Japan.

LIGHT/CHAOS:
------------
HAKAISHIN: 
The Hakaishin serve as a counterbalance to the Majin, and in comparison to the
easy-goingness of the Majin, are strict with both themselves and others. The
Hakaishin often wield the power of destruction and rebirth.
JIBOSHIN: 
Goddesses of the mother earth. They have the sides of both a mother's love and
the fierceness of nature. They are rather old dieties.
KUNITSUKAMI:
Allies of the Kishin, the old Gods of Earth from Japanese tradition.
RYUJIN: 
The Ryujin are ancient dragon gods. Powerful and intelligent, they rank among
the oldest of the gods, and their wisdom surpasses that of humanity with the
experience they have by quite a good margin.


LIGHT/NEUTRAL:
--------------
MAJIN: 
These are very powerful gods, often the heads of their pantheons and wielding
awesome power. Usually they're benevolent, widely-loved gods.
MEGAMI:
Megami are powerful and benevolent goddesses. They are most often gods of love,
fertility, and the like, and are among the kindest of the deities.
SHINSHO: 
The Twelve Shinsho from Hindu/Buddhist tradition that guard the directions of
the compass.
SHINJU: 
Very powerful gods that have the form of beasts or animals. They are strong and
fierce, and dedicated to rooting out and destroying evil. 
SEIREI: 
The Seirei are spirits of the four elements: Earth, Water, Fire, and Air.
SEIJU:
The Seiju are like a rank below that of the Shinju. They are holy beasts and
often have their own worshippers, but more often serve as the steeds for more
powerful gods, much like the Reicho.

NEUTRAL/LAW:
------------
TENSHI: 
These are all of the lower angels that fall under the command of the Daitenshi.
They are mostly messengers and foot-soldiers that operate and carry out all the
menial tasks of those angels ranking higher than they.
YOCHO: 
These demons are dangerous in the sense that they tempt humans and kidnap those
they take a liking to, but are primarily carriers of souls.
MESIAN:
The Mesians are humans that belong to the Church of Mesia, and believe strongly
in the tenets of Law. They fight for freedom from the demons, believing that a
savior will come to destroy them and bring about the rule of their god. The
Mesians hate the Gaians with a passion.

TRUE NEUTRAL:
-------------
YAMA:
Demons of the night that are usually very much like humans. While not evil per
se, a lot of them have the power to drain humans of their life energy--things
like vampires and succubi fall into this category.
MAJU:
Maju are your general-purpose animal demons. Dangerous, but not malicious.
Supernatural animals and monsters that are not gods or demons fall into this
category.
YOMA:
Yoma are usually powerful but low-ranking gods in their pantheons. They are
usually benevolent and helpful, but do not attract large numbers of followers
like the major deities in their pantheons.
CHIREI:
The Chirei are low-ranking demons that get their power from the earth, and are
often earth spirits. Many are powerful, the top Chirei even being deity-level,
but lack divine power that the other gods have.
YOSEI:
Yosei are fairies, sprites, and other such supernatural creatures--usually
rather benign and indifferent to the conflicts of the gods. Usually they're
just interested in having fun and pay little attention to more serious matters.
DEMONOID:
Demon-based, artificially created lifeforms.

NEUTRAL/CHAOS:
--------------
RYUO: 
Dragons that are like a step-down from the Ryujin. They are still quite
powerful in their own right.
KIJO:
The Kijo are warrior goddesses that cut down their enemies mercilessly. They
usually do not have enough worshippers to become major figures in their
pantheons, but can be quite powerful nonetheless.
YOKI:
Yoki are general purpose humanoid monsters--supernatural, but usually neither
god nor demon. They are similar to the Toki in that they are humanoid and
intelligent, but not as driven to fight. 
DATENSHI:
Datenshi are fallen angels that sided with Lucifer in his rebellion, whose
bodies were twisted and made ugly upon their defeat. While powerful, they are
lower-ranking and lack the power to become Maou that Lucifer's top generals
did.
GAIANS:
The Gaians are humans that belong to the Church of Gaia, which believes
strongly in the tenets of Chaos. Rather than destroy the demons, the Gaians
welcome them, and hope to establish a society where humans and demons can
coexist happily. The Gaians despise the Church of Mesia.

DARK/LAW:
---------
JASHIN: 
The Jashin are among the most evil and cruel of the gods, often spreading fear,
death, and pestilence among humanity. Often they are gods of death or the "evil
deity" in the "Good God-Evil God" pantheons.
KYOCHO: 
The Kyocho are mostly demon birds that are bringers of ill-omens to humanity.
Often they abduct humans to eat their souls or turn them into more of their
kind.
MACHINE: 
Mechanical robots. Also, puppet-like beings controlled by magical power.
VACCINE: 
Physical manifestations of programs designed to kill computer viruses.

DARK/CHAOS:
-----------
MAOU: 
Led by Lucifer himself, the Maou are mostly powerful ancient gods that were
turned into demons and thrown into the Abyss by YHVH. They are constantly
plotting to overthrow YHVH and his minions and restore the old order.
JARYU: 
The Jaryu are mostly dragons of low intelligence that cannot think of much
more than satisfying their own hunger and greed. They leave a trail of death
and destruction in their wake wherever they go.
YUKI: 
The Yuki are undead humans whose spirits were so strong that even in death they
manage to retain their bodies (or some sort of physical form) with their minds
more or less intact.
AKURYO: 
The Akuryo are undead, whose spirits were not as strong as those of the Yuki
and thus they could not keep a hold on their bodies. They travel about as
semi-corporeal ghosts or spirits, not being able to pass on.
GEDO:
Gedo are those demons and monsters that don't really fit into any other
category very well. Often weird things like blobs or slimes end up in this
category. Also, living people who are possessed by demons or spirits fall
into the Gedo category as well.
VIRUS: 
Physical manifestations of computer viruses.

DARK/NEUTRAL:
-------------
YOJUU: 
The Yoju are very similar to the Jaryu in that they are constantly afflicted
with an all-consuming hunger. They will attack and kill anything and everything
in order to consume it in a vain attempt at satiation.
SHIKI:
The Shiki are undead monsters, people or animals whose bodies were animated by
magic upon death. They are mindless drones with no intelligence or memories of
their former life--your basic zombies.
JAKI:
The Jaki are more or less your perfect example of a malevolent low-level demon.
They hate their lot in life and are filled with the need for revenge, and lash
out to bring others down with them.
YOJU:
Trees that have become sentient and attack people. Some think that they are
expressions of the Earth's anger.

                WELCOME TO THE JAKYO MANOR, WHERE DEMONS ASSEMBLE!

To those of you that can control and summon demonic menions, here is some
useful information.

Here at my Jakyo Manor, you can fuse the demon minions you have together, and
create even more powerful, new demons. It's not an exaggeration to say that I
have come close to perfecting the techniques of demon fusion.

Therefore, if you have demonic allies, then I will fuse them together for you.

As my goal is to achieve true perfection in the art of demon fusion, I will
perform all of these services at absolutely no cost to you.

You can get even more powerful demons than the ones you have, and I can perfect
my fusion techniques--it works out to be mutually beneficial for both of us.

You're unlikely to get any better deal than this!

Come to my Manors! I'll be waiting!

DETAILS:

If you have at least two minions, we can fuse them for you. You can fuse either
two or three demons together.

No matter which option you pick, you will see a fusion result list, and can
select from it to see your options. After you see the result, you can decide
whether or not you truly wish to perform the fusion.

As the demons you fuse will be stored in your Computer's stock, you can summon
them with the "COMP" command.

In addition, you cannot fuse any demons that you already have with you, or are
of higher level than you are.

Also, dead demons cannot be fused, so resurrect them before you bring them to
the Manor.


HOW TO READ THE FUSION RESULT LIST:
