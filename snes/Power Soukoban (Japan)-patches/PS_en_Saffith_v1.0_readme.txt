Known issue: minor graphical errors can occur at certain times.
This has been observed when opening or closing the subscreen, on
the game over screen, and during the credits. This is an issue in
the original game; this patch may make it slightly better or worse
depending on the emulator. I tried to minimize it in Higan.
