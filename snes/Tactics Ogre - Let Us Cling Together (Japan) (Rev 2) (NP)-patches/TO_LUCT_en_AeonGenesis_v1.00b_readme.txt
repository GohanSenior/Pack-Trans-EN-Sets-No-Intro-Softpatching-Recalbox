1.About Tactics Ogre
--------------------
Tactics Ogre doesn't really need much introduction. It's basically
the model for Final Fantasy Tactics, and is quite the impressive
feat for the SNES. The plot is full of intrigue and branching paths,
the gameplay is complicated and allows for lots of customization,
the music is standard (amazing) Sakimoto material.

****IMPORTANT NOTE****
Apply patch version 1.2 of the game!! It won't work on the others.

2.Patch History
---------------
God, don't talk to me about this. Every little task in this game was
like pulling teeth. The simplest thing took hours, crashes kept popping
up where there weren't any before. It's still not perfect, but it's
pretty damn good for what it is.

I do want to mention that this was originally a collaboration between
Dark Force of DeJap translations, LordTech, and disnesquick. I honestly
cannot say who did what; when the project was handed to me, the name
entry screen was done and the font was replaced, but not much else.
They'd dumped the Japanese script and rejigged the PS1 version's script
into a similar format (though I do remember helping them decipher that
script's storage format at the time.) I took that, inserted the English
script, reprogrammed the game to accept it, rewired all of the interfaces
and everything, ugh. More work (and trouble) than I was hoping for!

5.Application Instructions

****IMPORTANT NOTE****
Apply patch version 1.2 of the game!! It won't work on the others.
****IMPORTANT NOTE****

Quick ROM Info:
3.00MB (24mbit LoROM), WITHOUT Header (*exactly* 3,145,728 bytes)

Patch WILL expand the ROM to 4.00 megabytes (32mbit.)

If using ZSNES, make sure that the patch has the same name as your ROM.
In other words, if your ROM is called "tactics.smc" make sure the patch
is "tactics.ips" okay? If you're using a Mac, a Mac IPS patcher is
available. Check the AGTP Links page. If you're using a copier, you
probably already know how to patch the ROM :) Be sure to apply the
patch to a clean copy of the ROM, and make sure your ROM DOES NOT HAVE
A HEADER!. If you right-click the ROM and select Properties, it
should read "Size: 3.00 MB (3,145,728 bytes)".
