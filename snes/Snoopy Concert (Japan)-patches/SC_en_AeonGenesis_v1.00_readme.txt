1.About Snoopy Concert
----------------------
Snoopy Concert is less a game and more a collection of four smaller
ones. Snoopy (of Peanuts fame, yes that Snoopy) is preparing to give
a concert to the Peanuts gang, but so far, Marcie and Patty are the
only ones who've shown up. Snoopy (and occasionally Woodstock) must
then help solve the gang's various problems - with each character
having a distinctly different minigame to play. Rerun's segment is
a stroller chase, Schroeder's is a standard point-and-click style
abstract adventure game, Linus's is a bit of a reflex test and
Charlie Brown's is a trading game.

This is not the best game ever, but it is clever, cute, and a fun
diversion while it lasts. Personally, I liked Schroeder's game the
best.

Snoopy Concert is mouse compatible, so if you're playing via copier
or flashcart (or if your emulator supports the SNES Mouse) be sure
to try it the way it was meant to be played. It makes Rerun's segment
quite a bit easier, that's for sure...

2.Patch History
---------------
I don't even remember when I started working on this. If the file
creation dates are anything to go by, it looks like I first dumped
the script back in late summer, 2003... In any case, it was translated
fairly quickly, but due to some craziness with the text, the project
was shelved. The issue was resolved roughly three years later, in
September '06, which is when the bulk of the work was done. The
remainder of the project's work was script polishing, which was done
both by myself and by intrepid also-hacker, danke.

April 12, 2007 - Initial Version 1.00 release. Released in memory of
                 author Kurt Vonnegut; may he rest in peace.

4.Known Issues
--------------
--If Rerun crashes during the stroller segment, the word "CRUSH!"
  pops up in a little comic bubble. It should be "CRASH!"

Please report any other bugs, spelling errors, and
such on The Pantheon (http://donut.parodius.com/agtp)
Screenshots are preferred, as are (ZSNES format) savestates.

5.Application Instructions
--------------------------
If using ZSNES, make sure that the patch has the same name as your ROM.
In other words, if your ROM is called "snoopy.smc" make sure the patch
is "snoopy.ips" okay? If you're using a Mac, a Mac IPS patcher is
available. Check the AGTP Links page. If you're using a copier, you
probably already know how to patch the ROM :) Be sure to apply the
patch to a clean copy of the ROM, and make sure your ROM DOES NOT HAVE
A HEADER!. If you right-click the ROM and select Properties, it
should read "Size: 2.00 MB (2,097,152 bytes)". SNESTool will remove all
of your headers for you easily, and you can find it at
http://www.romhacking.net
In the Utilities section, simply search for snestool.

An easy way to tell if the game has a header or not is that if you
apply the patch and the game does not boot, your game very likely does
have a header.

-----------------
6.Troubleshooting
-----------------
--If the game does not run at all, read the above section on
  application instructions (specifically on header removal.)
  Make sure your ROM is not read-only when you remove its header.
