2. Ultra Baseball Jitsumeiban
================================================================================

"This is the ultimate baseball game! Precise pitching, bulls-eye batting, and 
Awesome fielding! It's all under your control with simpler yet more 
sophisticated operation. With loads of features, you'll be an All Star! It is 
the ultimate baseball simulation you've dreamed of."

Ultra Baseball Jitsumeiban (or Real Names Version) is the third game released in 
the Ultra Baseball Series. The first two games were released in the US under the 
titles of "Baseball Simulator 1,000".

The Baseball games are unique as they allow players to fully edit and automate 
entire leagues and seasons. Additionally it's the optional "super power" 
Ultra League that gives players the unique ability to well....play some very 
wacky baseball!

-Ultra Baseball: released in 1989 for the NES as "Baseball Simulator 1,000".

-Super Ultra Baseball: released in 1991 for the SNES as "Super Baseball Simulator 1,000".

-Ultra Baseball Jitsumeiban: released in 1992 for the SNES in Japan only. This is 
basically Super Ultra Baseball w/ real names (Jitsumeiban means Real Names Version). 
The graphics and sound are slightly better, and there is a new pennant option but 
this obviously uses the same engine. 

-Super Ultra Baseball 2: released in 1994 for the SNES in Japan only. Culture Brain 
planned to release this title as "Super Baseball Simulator 1,000 2" but canceled shortly 
after. This game uses a new engine and sports more features - yes this project is in the
works too!

-Ultra Baseball Jitsumeiban 2: Same engine as SUBB2, but with real players and some 
additional features. Most of this game has been translated into English by Tuffy da Bubba
and is currently being revised and completed along w/ SUBB2.  

-Ultra Baseball Jitsumeiban 3: 1995, new engine, completely players even have numbers on
their jerseys.

-Pro Yakyuu Star: 1996, same engine as UBBJ3 but cartoon mode only and no ultra powers.

6. Translation Notes 
================================================================================

Jitsumeiban as the title suggests is the "Real Player Version" thus this game used 
real players from NPB. It would have been too time consuming to have romanized 
players names and anyone who actually cares about the real players would more then 
likely speak Japanese and not have a need for this patch.

7. Hacking UBBJ Teams & Players
================================================================================

So you want to avoid the limited edit mode and hardcode your edit into the ROM eh?
Well don't ask me what codes change what, I didn't bother w/ that and won't...but
here's the locations to get you started.

uniform codes (2 bytes before name): 
Start at: $18013 

The first team - CARPS: 0000 $18013

CARPS (name in text) - 0000 (is the team uniform) - $18013 is the offset location

Second team - DRAGONS: 0101 $18033  and so on. 

Player names (fielders):
Start at: $18252 (first fielder of the first team, CARPS)
End at: $1967A (last fielder of the last team, CB) 

Player names (pitchers):
Start at: $19692 (again first p of first team)
End at: $1A09A  

You only need the English table for this: 

0A=A
0B=B
0C=C
0D=D
0E=E
0F=F
10=G
11=H
12=I
13=J
14=K
15=L
16=M
17=N
18=O
19=P
1A=Q
1B=R
1C=S
1D=T
1E=U
1F=V
2C=W
2D=X
2E=Y
2F=Z
