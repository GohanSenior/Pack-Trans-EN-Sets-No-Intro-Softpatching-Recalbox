Warriors
Legend of the Blue Dragon
~The Two Heroes~

Translation Patch (Version 2)


Version Two
  - Changes some tutorial dialogues from button pauses to delayed auto-closing,
      which should fix player input not responding as expected.
  - Fixes dialogue windows that may display incorrectly if every single tile is used.
  - Rearranges load menu labels to account for the longest save location name.
  - Adjusts text centering code to be better centered.
