1.0	Information


1.1		****Patch Information****

	This patch when hard patched correctly will result in a VALID checksum.

	This patch was created for use on an original ROM that has:

	  * NO header
	  * CRC32: 0xE8798F65
	  * NSRT (http://www.romhacking.net/utils/400/) identified as:
	    Dual Orb II, Version 1.0, 0x7868 Checksum

	The 'TransPatch.exe' custom patching application can be used to ensure 
	you have the correct ROM and patch, and apply the patch to headered or 
	non-headered ROMs automatically. This is the recommended way to apply 
	the patch for novice patchers.

	The patcher should work on Win95/98/ME/2000/XP/Vista/7/8, as well as 
	Linux under Wine. It should be self explanatory to use. You will be 
	asked for your ROM file and your IPS patch file. The program will alert 
	you if any errors are found or upon a successful patching job. 

	An xDelta format patch is also provided for reliable patching in all other
	cases. xDelta patchers are available on all platforms. Popular choices are:
		
	  * MultiPatch (MacOS X)  - http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/746/
	  * Delta Patcher (Win/Linux) - http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/704/
	  * xdelta UI (Win .NET/Linux Mono) - http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/598/

2.0		Introduction and words about the project


	Finally! At long last, I give to you Dual Orb 2 in full English glory! 
	It's been a long year and a half. I know there are other projects out 
	there that have taken longer, but I have worked almost entirely, and 
	exclusively on Dual Orb 2 for the full year and a half. I never really 
	took any extended breaks either! Alot of work has gone into this 
	project. I have been a one man team aside from Akujin. 
		
	When Akujin came on board, he translated the entire script, 
	retranslating what was already done and continuing right to the end. I 
	think he did a wonderful job, and with a final edit done by himself and 
	David Mullen, the story came out very well written and very enjoyable! 
	It was a pleasure working with Akujin, and I think you'll be very happy 
	with his work. 
		 
	I think this project was one of fairly high magnitude. With 343 text 
	blocks, multiple methods of evil compression, and all around general 
	evilness, it was definitely a challenging feat to hack/translate. Others 
	tried and failed, but this time we were successful! I say 'we' because 
	it was a team effort. The romhacking community for the most part is a 
	team. I couldn't have done it without the help and support from my 
	fellow hackers! =) Because of that, I give this translation to the scene 
	as my contribution, for all the hard work they have done for many of the 
	translated wonders we can now play because of them. And for the respect, 
	friendliness and help that many of those individuals have shown me. I 
	also give this translation to the public, for their support in hopes 
	that they will give this little gem of a game a chance, and so they may 
	enjoy a game that would otherwise not been accessible for them to play. 

	I believe this quality of this project has turned out to be amongst the 
	best of fan translations. It may not be a Square game, or Tales of 
	Phantasia, or Star Ocean, but it is a good game in it's own regards and 
	has received what I believe to be a quality translation approaching that 
	of the aforementioned games. So, without further delay, I present to you 
	Dual Orb 2 in English brought to you by Nightcrawler's Translation 
	Corporation! Enjoy! 
    

3.0		About the Game


	I think this is a very good RPG. It is rather linear, but it has great 
	music, pretty nice looking graphics, and a very nice story. The 
	characters are light-hearted and it simply a fun game to play! It has a 
	very rare weapon system for RPG's. The weapons are upgradeable and have 
	19 levels. You can upgrade them in the blacksmith, or find them in 
	treasure chests. Sometimes you can even get a cursed weapon at level -1! 

	The game is HARD! When I say hard, I mean HARD! You will be begging for 
	mercy from the bosses later in the game. The first half isn't that bad, 
	it's the second half that'll get ya. If your sick and tired of today's 
	cheesy easy RPG's, this game is for you! You'll definitely get a 
	challenging experience. I'm definitely excited to be able to share my 
	work with the rest of you and give you a chance to play something you 
	otherwise wouldn't be able to! The patch is 100% and fully translated, 
	but does have a few glitches mentioned in this readme! 

	So enjoy the patch!! If you have any questions, comments, concerns or 
	anything to say at all, feel free to post on my message board. If you 
	get stuck in the game, the message board is the best place to go for 
	help! You can find it all at: 
			
			http://transcorp.romhacking.net
		
	Oh yeah, hey feel free to send me some supportive e-mails! It's tough to 
	work on projects when you feel unappreciated sometimes. Appreciation 
	gives us Rom hackers inspiration to continue! 


4.0		Credits


	These are pretty short being I've been basically a one man team! haha

	Project Coordinator:    Nightcrawler
	ROM hacker:             Nightcrawler
	Translator:             Akujin
	Script Editing:         Akujin/David Mullen 


5.0		What you will find in this patch:


	It's complete now, so you SHOULD find everything 100% translated!
	There are a few known issues though, mentioned below. 

	You will also find myself, Nightcrawler, hidden in the game somewhere. 
	I didn't change the sprites, so I am identifiable by text only. :) I 
	will speak some humorous dialogue having to do with my 'wife' in the 
	game, also in that location. I am married in real life for anyone 
	wondering :) I have a wife whom has been very understanding over the 
	past year and a half competing with Dual Orb 2 for my time! haha =) 

	Sorry, there really aren't any other Easter eggs that I have put in the 
	patch. I think the game speaks for itself and doesn't need any 
	'additions'. 


6.0		Known Issues:

	
6.1		Original Game Bugs:


	1. Kardosa Castle, Empty Windows after Sindra fight - After defeating 
	Sindra, you may try to 'talk' to the lift control panel or ledge by the 
	lava. The original game crashes here. The patch does not, but text 
	windows are blank instead. 


6.2		Known Patch Issues:


	None!


6.3 	Non-Issues to Note:


	1. Treasure Chest Weapons - Say you open a treasure chest and it says 
	you got a Spear. It doesn't specify what level Spear it is. It's NOT 
	supposed to. When you go to equip it, it will say Atk: ?. It's a mystery 
	UNTIL you equip it and its identity is revealed! (Watch out for cursed 
	weapons)
