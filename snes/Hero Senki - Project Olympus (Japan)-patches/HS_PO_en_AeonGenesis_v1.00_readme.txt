1.About Hero Chronicle
----------------------
Hero Chronicle is a crossover RPG featuring Gundam, Ultraman,
and Kamen Rider properties. It's also adjacent to Super Robot
Wars, featuring a few original Banpresto characters and Gilliam
Jaeger's first ever appearance. I believe (although am not certain)
that it was Banpresto's first ever RPG on the Super Nintendo, and
from a timeline perspective takes place between SRW2 and SRW3,
though not in the same world.

2.Patch History
---------------
Roughly two years ago I got it into my head that it would be fun
to see the five main Compati Hero games (SD Great Battle 1-5) done
and released all at the same time. SRW OG: The Moon Dwellers had
released earlier that year - in English no less - and SDGB seemed
like they would be good/important from a historical perspective.
Hero Chronicle joined that list shortly thereafter.

December 24, 2019 - Initial v1.00 release

5.Application Instructions

Quick ROM Info:
1.50 MB (12mbit LoROM) WITHOUT header. (*exactly* 1,572,864 bytes)
No header.

If using ZSNES, make sure that the patch has the same name as your ROM.
In other words, if your ROM is called "herochron.smc" make sure the patch
is "herochron.ips" okay? If you're using a Mac, a Mac IPS patcher is
available. Check the AGTP Links page. If you're using a copier, you
probably already know how to patch the ROM :) Be sure to apply the
patch to a clean copy of the ROM, and make sure your ROM DOES NOT
HAVE A HEADER!. If you right-click the ROM and select Properties, it
should read "1.50MB (1,572,864 bytes)". TUSH will remove all
of your headers for you easily, and you can find it at
http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/608/

An easy way to tell if the game has a header or not is that if you
apply the patch and the game does not boot, your game very likely does
have a header.
