1.About SRW Gaiden
------------------
Super Robot Wars Gaiden follows the original story of Masaki Andoh, herald
of the Elemental Lord Cybuster, both before and after events of the original
Super Robot Wars canon (SRW 2, 3, EX, 4.) It is the first Super Robot War to
only contain original characters and plots, the first (and one of the few)
to have its mechanicals represented in a realistic, non-SD style, the first
to be isometric. It and its followups are, to my knowledge, the only SRWs
to feature directional and height modifiers to damage and accuracy
calculations. Due to its nature as an original story, and due to it taking
place at the very beginning of Masaki's timeline, it serves as an excellent
entrypoint into the Super Robot Wars series.

This project's history is long and fraught with trouble. The initial script
translation turned out to be wrong more often than it was accurate; it was
eventually decided that the entire script would need to be retranslated.
Work on the script essentially re-started from scratch in late 2013 after
TheMajinZenki graciously offered to doublecheck the older version of the
translation. Though a variety of factors (lack of resources, split
attention, and the like) contributed to a less-than-optimal velocity,
the script was considered to be fully retranslated in April of 2017.
Work on the technical pieces resumed at this time; additionally, at this
point we passed it off to Caitlin, who worked closely with Zenki as an
editor, to produce the script as it currently stands. She finished in
October. Playtesting began in February and completed in mid May.

For all the problems it has had during its long development period, I am
extraordinarily proud of how the final release looks. Have fun!

5.Application Instructions
--------------------------
Quick ROM Info:
3.00 MB (24mbit SA-1) WITHOUT header. (*exactly* 3,145,728 bytes)
No header.

If using ZSNES, make sure that the patch has the same name as your ROM.
In other words, if your ROM is called "srwg.smc" make sure the patch
is "srwg.ips" okay? If you're using a Mac, a Mac IPS patcher is
available. Check the AGTP Links page. If you're using a copier, you
probably already know how to patch the ROM :) Be sure to apply the
patch to a clean copy of the ROM, and make sure your ROM DOES NOT
HAVE A HEADER!. If you right-click the ROM and select Properties, it
should read "3.00MB (3,145,728 bytes)". TUSH will remove all
of your headers for you easily, and you can find it at
http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/608/

An easy way to tell if the game has a header or not is that if you
apply the patch and the game does not boot, your game very likely does
have a header.

------------------
6.Optional Patches
------------------
Included with the translation is one optional patch, and an additional
"undo" patch which will remove the patch's effects from your ROM should you
decide you don't like it. The patch is entirely standalone and does not
require the translation, so if for instance you decide you want Music
Persistence in your Japanese copy of the game, you can apply that one patch
and be on your way.

MUSIC PERSISTENCE
Super Robot War titles are strategy games, characterized by units moving
around a map and attacking one another in special animated sequences, during
which music plays from the player's (or boss's/Elzam's) unit's TV show,
movie, OVA, etc. It's usually a theme song from the show's opening sequence,
but since Masoukishin does not contain any licensed properties, they're all
various theme songs written for the original characters that appear in the
game.

In later SRW titles, the unit's theme music will continue to play
after the animated sequence ends and the game returns you to the map. This
tends to make the games feel more exciting, as the music is generally
designed to get the viewer invested in the show. Older SRW titles, however,
would stop the theme music as soon as the animated sequence ends, and would
start the map music over from the beginning. As a direct result, you never
heard much of the robot's themes OR the map music unless you deliberately
stuck around and waited to listen.

The Music Persistence patch changes the music behavior in SRWG to be more
like the later games in the series. Once an attack sequence begins and a
theme song starts playing, the theme song will continue to play until either
the turn ends or a unit from a different series takes part in a battle
sequence.
