Majin Tensei
American English Translation Patch (Version 4)
General Information and Credits

-----------------------
  GENERAL INFORMATION
-----------------------

This version three patch is for Majin Tensei on the Super Famicom.
The text has been translated from Japanese into American English.

The patch has been updated to fix a line in the Heretic's Manor that had a small chance of appearing as garble, an incorrect stat description for one of the items, a word that was left off of one of the Game Over screens, and an unformatted line in a fusion screen.

Two patching formats are provided, so you can use either .bps or .ips.
(Do not apply both patches.)

Note: Not all of the Majin Tensei roms are compatible with this patch.
It is only compatible with the version 1.0 Japanese rom.

Comments from DDStranslation, the hacker:

It was good to work with Tom and FlashPV again on this last MegaTen game for the SNES.
I tried to keep the modifications simple with this project, which should hopefully result in fewer bugs and stay in line with the minimalist style of the original game.

Comments from Tom, the translator:

Some people were disappointed that I chose to translate Majin Tensei II even though part one hadn't been translated, so I did this first entry in the series too (for the sake of completion).

Comments from FlashPV, the pixel artist:

I just had to draw a new title screen so it was not a big deal for me, but it's always a pleasure to work with DDS and Tom. Can't wait for the next project!
