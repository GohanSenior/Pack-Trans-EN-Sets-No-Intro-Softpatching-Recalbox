1. Installation

Apply the IPS patch to the No-Intro "Melfand Stories (Japan).sfc".

If you want to have proper english punctuation and don't care about the original japanese graphics, pick the "-optional" patch instead. Changes the aesthetics slightly, see png for reference. Original is recommended.


2. Game Summary

This is a complete english translation of Melfand Stories for SFC/SNES. The game is a side-scrolling arcade like action game, with nice graphics and simple gameplay. The branching story is set in a stereotypical, but charming fantasy setting. Depending on the hero that you play and the paths that you choose, you get a little bit backstory about the characters. One of 3 companions will support you in the final battle. Game features 9 Levels totsal and is kind of short.


3. Translation Notes

Many parts of the game are already in english, these parts got translated:
- Intro
- Character profiles
- Endings
- Dialogues
- Music Titles

There isn't much space for text on the screen, basically just 1-2 lines with max 32 characters. The script was translated with these restrictions in mind for roman alphabet.

On the character profile screens, the "RG" stands for "Range" and the hearts indicate the attack range, it's not in the original game but there was extra space for that.


4. Game Tips from the Manual

- You get an extra credit at 20k score and then every 40k
- When you press down while jumping, you will be invincible for a moment
- Press R and you can attack the other playable character (no damage is dealt though)
- The little Thief guy that runs across the screen and tries to steal your items, wait until he stole from you, then attack him to get an extra apple
- Necklaces give resistance
