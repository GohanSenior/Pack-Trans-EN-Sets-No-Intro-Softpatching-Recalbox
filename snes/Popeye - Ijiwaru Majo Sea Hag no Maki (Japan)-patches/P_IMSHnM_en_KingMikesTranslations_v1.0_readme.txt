Popeye - Tale of Teasing Witch Sea Hag
Patch v1.0
Release date: 12/25/2008
*********************************************
Original Language: Japanese
Original Title: Popeye - Ijiwaru Majo Sea Hag no Maki
*********************************************

This is a platformer/board game based on Popeye, of course!

The witch Sea Hag has plotted to stop Popeye once again,
this time by turning Popeye's friends to stone.
His friends hearts' have floated away, attracting
General Blozo. Blozo plots to have everybody steal
the hearts for the military, paying them to do so.

Can Popeye save his friends?

This game was developed by Technos in Japan and America,
but for some reason was never released outside Japan.
That's too bad, as it is one of the better cartoon-based
games.

Emulation Status:
 Any good SNES emulator should support this.
 I haven't tested this on a console, but I don't see any reason
 it wouldn't work.

*********************************************
What's done:
 - Almost everything.

What's left:
 - Character names for the passwords. Might be a bit of work,
   as it seems tiles are reused, contrary to previous thought.
 - As you may notice, there were timing issues with the ending.
   I've made the delay between strings VERY short, so as to fit
   all the text in before it cuts to the credits.
   While it seems to work out, as most events are timed to the
   text, a couple events aren't, and I don't think I can
   easily fix them.

*********************************************
How to patch:

It'd be better to use the UPS format patch.
 - Download tsukiyomi from byuu.cinnamonpirate.com
 - Click Apply Patch to an Existing File
 - Choose the UPS file and the ROM as requested, click Apply Patch.

But if you have to use IPS, I'd suggest LunarIPS.

PROPER ROM:
 - 1.5MB, CRC: F9171003, NO HEADER.

*********************************************
How to play:
 Initially, the opening story will appear. You can watch, or press Start to
   go to the title screen.
 At the title screen, press Start, then choose Start to begin a new game,
   Pass Word to continue an earlier game. (Passwords are given after finishing a stage.)
 Then choose a 1 or 2 Player game.
 Choose Options to go to the Options menu. You can change the button settings, listen
  to a sound test, or choose stereo/mono sound.
 Default controls:
  D-Pad - Move
  Select Button - Press on the map screen and you can scroll with the D-Pad. Press again to return.
  Start Button - Pause in a level.
  A Button - Unused
  B Button - Jump during a stage or cancel on the map screen.
  X Button - Use a special anchor.
  Y Button - Attack with the anchor, or confirm choices on the map screen. Hold in a stage to run.
  L/R Button - Choose a special anchor.

 As a stage begins, you will be shown where all the hearts are on the map. Count them. That is
  how many you must collect before Bluto will appear on the map. Fight Bluto to finish the stage.
 On the map, you can press Select if you would like to scroll the map. When you're ready to move,
  press the Y Button to roll the spinner. Press Y again to stop, or it will eventually stop itself.
 Then use the D-Pad to move. You can retrace steps to undo moves.
 If you bump into an enemy, you will fight them. They are also after hearts, so you will have to
  fight them to retrieve the hearts they've collected.
 (PROTIP: While scrolling the map or spinning, you are immune to encounters. Spam this if an enemy
  you don't want to fight approaches! After you've finished rolling, you can't spam-scroll,
  though.)

 Some of the special anchors:
  Fly - Popeye grows a propeller. You can fly around the stage.
  Frog - Popeye can walk through narrow passages safely (Popeye can try to slide, by pressing
   Down while running. But if he doesn't make it through, he'll hit his head on the ceiling and
   lose a life.)
   Like Mario 3, you can also swim better as a frog.
   You can press Y to lick the enemies.
   However, frogs also have one-hit deaths.
  Wheel - Popeye can roll through the stages, attacking enemies who cross his path.

 Items:
  Coins - Trade 100 for an extra life, or spend them on the map.
  Popeye Doll - An extra life.
  Hearts - Gotta catch 'em all! :P
  Turkey - Recover all health.

 Spaces on the board:
 White tile - usually nothing, maybe a Bluto encounter (you must avoid him on three passes).
 Blue tile - usually positive effects (free moves, health recovery).
 Red tile - usually negative effects (damage, forced movement across the board).
 Turkey - visit the Rough House. For 5 coins, you can have a free turkey
 Anchor - You can buy random special anchors.
 Casino - Play the slots!
 Stages - If there's a heart on the map, be sure to find it in the stage!

No distributing the patch with ROM, either pre-patched, or in one zip.
That's wrong.
