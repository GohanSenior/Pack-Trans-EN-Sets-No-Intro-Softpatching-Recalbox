How to play:

Main screen:
	Walk with pad.
	Press A to speak.
	Press X for menu.

Battle:

This game uses a unique battle system, called the Dyna-Real Battle System.

In this game, you set directions for what actions each character should perform in battle. They act automatically,
carrying out whatever orders you have placed in their battle strategy. You assign each character 3 commands at once:
one action to perform alot, another to perform sometimes, and a last action you want them to perform alittle.
(okay, so actually, the main action has a 70% probability, and the other two are each 15% probable)

Open the main menu. There is an option called "Battle Plan".
Here, you have 3 different strategies you can assign to each party member: Attack, Defend, and Skill
(in that order, from left to right), with the last two being Escape and Urgent. Escape is for running from non-boss
battles, and Urgent takes place when a character's HP or POWER (points used by all? actions in battle) runs low.

Each plan has a limit to what you can use:
Attack - Weapon, Shield, Item	(no spells)
Defend - Weapon, Shield, Spell  (no items)
Spell  - Weapon, Spell, Item	(no shield)

     During battle:
	Press A to choose battle style.
		Then, press Up/Down to choose battle style.
		Press Left/Right to choose character.
		Press A to confirm, B to cancel.
	Press X for menu.
	Press L/R to scroll up/down battlefield.
      Select Button: This is pretty useful. It allows you to change all characters to a certain Plan at once,
          when pushed simultaneously with another button:

         Defend
            X

  Skill  Y     A  Attack

            B

         Escape

Probably the easiest way to think of it is: Select+B to escape battle, other three buttons to active the 3 Plans, right
   to left:

        Plan 2 (Defend)
                  X
Plan 3 (Skill)   Y A   Plan 1 (Attack)

Also, if you take more than 6 minutes in a single battle, you die instantly. So be prepared!
PROTIP: Defend often. Defending self-restores HP and POWER gradually.

No distributing the patch with ROM, either pre-patched, or in one zip.
That's wrong.
