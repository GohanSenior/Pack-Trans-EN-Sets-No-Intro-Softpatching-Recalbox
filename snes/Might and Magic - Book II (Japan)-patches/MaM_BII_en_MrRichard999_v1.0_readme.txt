ROM MODIFICATIONS DONE BY MRRICHARD, D.D.S., AND DR.FLOPPY
TRANSLATION DONE BY AGENTORANGE
SPECIAL THANKS TO DACKR FOR IMPLEMENTING INTRO SCREEN

ALSO THANKS TO DARKUNDERLORD'S RPG CODEX FOR THEIR SUPPORT AND THEIR FORUM!

TESTING DONE BY GRAUKEN, MUSCLESPARK, MUSTARD, AND NOSTALJADED.

THIS PATCH TRANSLATES ALL THE DIALOGUE, TEXT, AND ITEMS INTO ENGLISH.
SOME CHANGES MADE ALSO REFLECT MORE TO BE IN CANON WITH THE OTHER
SERIES WITH THE ITEM NAMES, MAGIC, AND A FEW OF THE MEMBERS YOU
CAN RECRUIT AS THE JAPANESE VERSION HAD MADE DRASTIC CHANGES
WHICH WERE UNRECOGNIZABLE FOR THOSE FAMILIAR WITH THE SERIES.

ALSO IN ADDITION, THIS PATCH FIXES THE USE OF THE FINAL BATTLE MUSIC
TO BE USED WHEN ENCOUNTERING SHELTEM. THIS WAS PREVIOUSLY UNUSED.
SPECIAL THANKS TO THE CUTTING ROOM FLOOR FOR DOCUMENTING THIS.

ALSO FOR THOSE WHO TRY TO IMPORT THEIR PARTY WITH THE MIGHT & MAGIC 1
CODE WILL HAVE ISSUES AS THE AMOUNT OF CHARACTERS IS OFF...
IF YOU WISH TO CHEAT IT, YOU CAN VISIT THIS SITE AND CREATE YOUR
OWN CONTINUATION CODE WHICH GIVES A SMALL BONUS AT THE START
OF YOUR GAME - http://tinypink.jog.client.jp/2/Data/Tips.html
