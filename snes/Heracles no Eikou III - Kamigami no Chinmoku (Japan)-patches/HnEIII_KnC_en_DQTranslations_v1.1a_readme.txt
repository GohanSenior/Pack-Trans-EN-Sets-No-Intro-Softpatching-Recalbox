	While trying out various games for the Super Famicom a couple of years ago, I 
stumbled upon a spectacular find: Glory of Heracles 3. Immediately I took a liking to
the Dragon Quest feel of the game with it's unique Greek twist. Although most English
gamers have never heard of the series, the games has an enormous amount of fans in 
Japan. 
	The story of Glory of Heracles 3 consists of the protagonist who wakes up in 
a village of pixies without even remembering his name. Throughout the game the protagonist
(which is named by you) is continually brought to a dream world while he sleeps. Along
the journey he finds others whom he saw in the dream and searches to reveal his true 
self and his past. Companions gather along the way and overcome many great tribulations
together. Some of these include being swallowed by a giant sea monster, using the great
Trojan horse, flying daedalus' kite, speaking with the divine Lord Zeus, and much much
more. 

Some features of the game include.
- 5 party member system
- Customizable windowing system
- Jumping off cliffs!
- Use of a ship for transportaion
- Use of Pegasus for flying
- Great unique spell names
- Dress your main character up as a woman!
- 116 enemies
- Dictionary of the gods
- Reion's Diary
- Bury and store items almost anywhere
- Learn to be a master harp player with the minigame

	So I hope your looking to enjoy another classic. For me, this game provided 
some great unexpected feature around every corner. For more information visit

Here's some things I still have yet to work out. 

- The battle text seems to jump a few lines sometimes. 
- Cursed status doesn't have a message, only a different color for the afflicted 
character. 
- The game is supposed to check the names you give to your characters against the ones 
used in game so you don't call them Zeus, Poseidon or the same name as your other party 
members. This doesn't work in our version.
- Some overflows might remain in the current version.
- In the end sequence, the dialog causes several minor graphical corruptions in the 
background.

That's about it for now. The game should be completely playable from start to finish.

	Patch on a headerless unexpanded rom. Softpatching won't work because my patch 
expands the game. If you want to softpatch, hard patch first and than make an ips 
against an expanded rom.
