Story (from the manual)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once upon a time, there was something called "Glory of the Past", which was
wonderful...

It is now 1994 AD. Four years after a parent-child fight involving the whole
universe, the world was once again at peace thanks to the four brave men who
defeated Takobee, the evil master. However, the brave ones were not welcomed by
the world, and lived a lonely life.

One day, Mr. Parodius, who was lying on the cutting board of an octopus jar at
home, having not yet healed from his wounds from the previous was, called his
eldest son Takosuke.

"Could you search for the "Glory of the Past" for me? I'd like to see the good
old days once more before an eagle picks me up and cooks me."

According to the rumors, an octopus named Yukari (also known as A-Ko Tako) in
the "Parodius" Disco is hiding it. Upon hearing that, Takosuke took his favorite
sun visor and ran out of home looking for the "Glory of the Past".

And thus, the Parodius Legion was formed again. Counting with Takosuke,
Vic Viper, TwinBee and Pentaro, along with seven new friends. In search of the
"Glory of the Past", Takosuke left with his ten friends!

Translation Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Stage 3 Candy Land

At the start of the stage, there's a relief of the Great Gourmet King Manjiri on
the wall next to the entrance. The kanji on his belly is 玉 (ball or valuable),
while the kanji for king is 王. Manjiri was a boss who was exclusive to the
PC Engine release of Paroius Da! He appears in the special stage when the player
arrives at the boss with between 900,000 and 1 million score.
The slight change to the kanji for 'king' is most likely a pun to show that he's
no longer respected enough to be the boss of the stage and maybe also that he's
round as a ball (fat). 玉 is also the Japanese counting word for round food.
A ¥ graphic was made to reflect the value / prosperity meaning of 玉, but since
this is likely not the meaning the devs intended, the original kanji was left
untouched instead.

### Stage 4 Traffic Signs

ぴよこ県警(秘)基地 (Piyoko Prefectural Police Secret Base)
Piyoko (or Pyoko) is the name of the female bird enemies. The male version is
called Kokekko.

リカー○× (Liquor ○×)
Liquor store with a placeholder name (○×).

鳥商店通 (Bird Shopping Avenue)
This sign is very hard to read and the first kanji (鳥, bird) can only be
guessed. Since space is limited, we added a bird icon.

大変ご迷惑をおかけいたしております。 (We apologize for any inconvenience caused.)
A common sign at a construction site


### Interruption Stage X (Moai Battleship)

兄弟船 (Kyōdai Bune, Brother Ship) is a popular Japnese song by Ichirō Toba from
1982. I encourage you to look it up, it's quite nice.

一番星 (Ichibanboshi, First star on the night sky) and 御意見無用 (Go-iken Muyō,
Don't give me your opinion, I just do what I want) are references to the
Truck Yarō or Truck Rascals movies that came out in the 1970s in Japan.
Go-iken Muyō is the subtitle of the first movie and Ichibanboshi is one of the
main characters. The translation for this sign was tricky and changed a couple
times. "Keep Your Opinions" (...because I don't want them) almost made it into
the final version, but was replaced by "Save Your Breath" (...because you won't
change my mind). Another alternative was "Unbreakable Spirit".

### Stage 6 Rabbit

竹取家 月面4丁目 (House Taketori, Surface of the Moon, Block 4)
Taketori Monogatari, The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter, is also known as The Tale of
Princess Kaguya. The Ghibli movie by the same name is worth a watch if you're
unfamiliar with the story.


### Ending

メンソーレ (めんそーれ, mensoore) means welcome in Okinawan dialect. The pixels make
it look like メンソール (menthol), but mensoore is the more likely meaning.
Another Konami game of the time, Ganbare Goemon 2, starts on an island near
Okinawa.


Hidden Message
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There's a hidden developer message in the ROM file at offset 0x30000.

JP: iroiro atte iroiro arisugite yoku ironnakotogarawo kangaerukotoga dekimasen
shibaraku boutto saseteoitekudasai gomennasai    
EN: There's so much going on, there's too much going on. I can't really think
about all the things that are going on, so please let me dwell on it for a
while. I'm sorry.


Dev notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The translation of the Cappuccino boss fight was remade three times from the
ground up, which took many, many hours. This was the most complex part of the
hack. The final version has slightly better optimization than the original
Japanese fight, which lowers flicker a bit. I hope someone enjoys it.
