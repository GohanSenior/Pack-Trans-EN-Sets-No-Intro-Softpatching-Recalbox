1.About Magical Pop'n
---------------------
Magical Pop'n is a fun, spazzy little sidescroller game
with a very light and cheery theme. I'm not going to
describe it much here, the story isn't very deep, but
it's fun and funny, so yeah! Fun!

4.Known Issues with the Patch
-----------------------------
-The final screen of the ending might not show up on a copier.
But it probably will. So don't worry 'bout it.

This patch has not been officially tested.
It worked fine after doing the ASM and replacing the text
for the introduction, but something might've broken now that
the ending's done, so if you find any bugs, let me know on my
forum, The Pantheon (http://donut.parodius.com/agtp).

5.Application Instructions
--------------------------
If using ZSNES, make sure that the patch has the same name as your ROM.
In other words, if your ROM is called "popn.smc" make sure the patch
is "popn.ips" okay? If you're using a Mac, a Mac IPS patcher is
available. Check the AGTP Links page. If you're using a copier, you
probably already know how to patch the ROM :) Be sure to apply the
patch to a clean copy of the ROM, and make sure your ROM DOES NOT HAVE
a header. If you right-click the ROM and select Properties, it
should read "2.00 MB (2,097,152  bytes)". SNESTool can remove any headers
for you easily, and you can find it at
http://rpgd.emulationworld.com
In the utilities section, click on the IPS Tools link.
Please note that your rom should be 2.12MB after the patch is applied.
