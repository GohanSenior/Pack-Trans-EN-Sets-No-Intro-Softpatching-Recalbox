1.About JoJo's Bizarre Adventure
--------------------------------
This is a short RPG based on Stardust Crusaders, the third arc of the
long-running JoJo's Bizarre Adventure manga. The first two arcs have
recently been adapted into TV anime, and the game picks up where they
left off; Jotaro is Joseph's son.

It's a somewhat abridged version of the story. Some of the events have
been shuffled around, some don't occur at all, some have been changed
completeley. It's an okay game, probably about five hours long, but
you probably need to be a fan of the property to get the most out of
it.

2.Patch History
---------------
This would have been an easy project had I elected to leave the font
as 8x8. But no, I decided to make it 8x16, and in so doing needed to
rewire nearly every menu so things fit better. Whoops! I'm mostly
happy with the end result, though.

April 13, 2013 - Initial V1.00 Release

4.Known Issues
--------------
--Cursor behavior in combat tends to stick a bit, however this occurs in
  the Japanese version of the game and is not the fault of the patch.
--Status screens are unstable and can crash the game, however this occurs
  in the Japanese version of the game and is not the fault of the patch.

5.Application Instructions
--------------------------
Quick ROM Info:
1.00 MB (8mbit LoROM) WITHOUT header. (*exactly* 1,048,576 bytes)
No header.

If using ZSNES, make sure that the patch has the same name as your ROM.
In other words, if your ROM is called "jojo.smc" make sure the patch
is "jojo.ips" okay? If you're using a Mac, a Mac IPS patcher is
available. Check the AGTP Links page. If you're using a copier, you
probably already know how to patch the ROM :) Be sure to apply the
patch to a clean copy of the ROM, and make sure your ROM DOES NOT
HAVE A HEADER!. If you right-click the ROM and select Properties, it
should read "1.00 MB (1,048,576 bytes)". TUSH will remove all
of your headers for you easily, and you can find it at
http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/608/

An easy way to tell if the game has a header or not is that if you
apply the patch and the game does not boot, your game very likely does
not have a header.

6.Gameplay Tips
---------------
--Does a battle seem unwinnable? Try using the "Idea!" command under the
  Tactics menu.
--Try Checking everywhere! Items get stashed in the damnedest places, and
  Checking the environment carefully can save you a lot of dosh.
