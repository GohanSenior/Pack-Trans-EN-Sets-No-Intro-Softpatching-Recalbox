3 - Notes:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The patch must be applied to a SNES rom without a header. I think.
 If you're too dumb to understand this, well, that's your problem.

 The following patch is available under a Creative Commons
 Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0) license. In broad
 terms, this means:

    This translation patch may be used for derivative work (such as a
    retranslation to another language) if the original patch creators (the owner
    of this website, the translator(s), graphic artists, and programmers) are
    fully credited within the derivative project itself or its accompanying
    documentation;

    This translation patch or any derivative works may not be used in any sort
    of commercial or for-profit projects, such as unlicensed reproduction carts;

    The resulting derivative work is redistributed under the same license and in
    the same format that it was originally downloaded in (a patch).

 TL;DR: Don't sell reproduction carts of this game translation; if you're going
 to retranslate the game, be sure to credit the team that created the original
 patch; and don't distribute patched versions of the game in any way, shape, or
 form - including prepatched roms AND reproduction carts.

 Buy a flash cart instead of wasting your money on an expensive reproduction
 cart that uses EEPROM chips which lose their data after a few years. Or, use
 a console-based or PC emulator. I'm totally fine with that. Please don't give
 your money to people who profit from stuff game translators do for free.
