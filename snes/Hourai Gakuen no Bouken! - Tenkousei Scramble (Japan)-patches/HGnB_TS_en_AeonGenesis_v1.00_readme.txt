1.About Hourai High
-------------------
The Adventures of Hourai High is a silly little RPG, with a Dragon Quest
combat presentation, a Final Fantasy 5-ish class system, and a sense of
humor straight out of Earthbound. You can tell that a lot of heart went
into the creation of this game. It's quite charming!

4.Known Issues
--------------
--*VERY* occasionally when there are a lot of enemies on-screen and you elect
  to use a skill that targets all of them, some of the letters in their names
  might not get printed. This is an exceedingly rare case and is purely
  cosmetic.

Please report any bugs, spelling errors, and such
on The Pantheon (http://agtp.romhack.net/pantheon)
Screenshots are preferred, as are savestates. SRAMs too if you can
create an Interrupt save in battle!

Quick ROM Info:
2.00MB (16mbit HiROM), WITHOUT Header (*exactly* 2,097,152 bytes)

Patch WILL expand the ROM to 3.00 megabytes (24mbit.)

If using ZSNES, make sure that the patch has the same name as your ROM.
In other words, if your ROM is called "hourai.smc" make sure the patch
is "hourai.ips" okay? If you're using a Mac, a Mac IPS patcher is
available. Check the AGTP Links page. If you're using a copier, you
probably already know how to patch the ROM :) Be sure to apply the
patch to a clean copy of the ROM, and make sure your ROM DOES NOT HAVE
A HEADER!. If you right-click the ROM and select Properties, it
should read "Size: 2.00 MB (2,097,152 bytes)".
