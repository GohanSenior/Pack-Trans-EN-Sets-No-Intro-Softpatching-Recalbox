(I) This patch should *NOT* be patched on top of an
existing Live-A-Live translation. I cannot and will
not be held responsible for any issues that arise as
a result of patching the older version.
(II) Several Live-A-Live ROMs available online may
be interleaved. This patch MUST be applied to a clean,
de-interleaved ROM *WITHOUT* a header. You can use NSRT,
available on all operating systems, to prepare your ROM.

1.About Live-A-Live
-------------------
Live-A-Live was released in Japan on September 2, 1994.
It is a fairly different sort of RPG; instead of one
large, lengthy story, LaL presents you with seven different
vignettes across different time periods. As you complete
them, suspicion grows that they may be more related than
they at first seem. For those of you who haven't played it
yet, I won't spoil what happens when all seven have been
cleared, but suffice to say that once you've completed the
game, you'll have experienced some of the most memorable
plot twists in all of RPG history.

2.Patch History
---------------
I started work on Live-A-Live in late October 2001, as a
project for a business class I was taking. I released it
on Christmas day less than two months later, despite
multiple hardware failures, inadequate equipment, and
lots of stress and headaches.

The resulting patch was acceptible for its time, but in
retrospect it was rushed, the text was crunched into its
available space, some of the hacking looked extremely
unprofessional, and on the whole, it could have been much,
much better.

Fastforward to about this time last year. I've started
work on a new version, I've recruited help on the technical
side of things while I focus my own efforts on writing, and
after a few more months, things are looking good. There are
*lots* of bugs, though, everything from text disappearing at
the end of lines to the autocenter code not working properly,
from mysterious ghost indents at the beginning of lines to
one character's sprite overwriting half of the others on the
story select menu.

That said, we have all of the issues worked out (we hope!)
It's gone through a few rigorous testing cycles, which
continue even as I write this. The end result is a patch
that blows everything else out of the water. This is very
likely Aeon Genesis's definitive work, exceeding possibly
even Rudra in its grandeur. There are features in this that
weren't even in the Japanese version, but I'll leave that
for the next section.

Quick ROM Info:
2.00MB (16mbit HiROM), WITHOUT Header (*exactly* 2,097,152 bytes)
The patch WILL expand the ROM to 2.50 megabytes.

If using ZSNES, make sure that the patch has the same name as your ROM.
In other words, if your ROM is called "lal.smc" make sure the patch
is "al.ips" okay? If you're using a Mac, a Mac IPS patcher is
available. Check the AGTP Links page. If you're using a copier, you
probably already know how to patch the ROM :) Be sure to apply the
patch to a clean copy of the ROM, and make sure your ROM HAS
A HEADER!. If you right-click the ROM and select Properties, it
should read "2.00 MB (2,097,152 bytes)". SNESTool will add all
of your headers for you easily, and you can find it at
http://rpgd.emulationworld.com
In the utilities section, click on the IPS Tools link.
The answers to the questions it asks you do not matter unless you're
using a copier to play the game.

An easy way to tell if the game has a header or not is that if you
apply the patch and the game does not boot, your game very likely does
not have a header.

Note that this should absolutely _NOT_ be patched over the old version
of the translation! That could cause all sorts of nasty issues, and I
will not be held responsible for any problems you may encounter because
of this.
