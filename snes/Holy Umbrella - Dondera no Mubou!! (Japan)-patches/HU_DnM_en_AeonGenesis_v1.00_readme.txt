1.About Holy Umbrella
---------------------
Holy Umbrella is a quirky little sidescroller with a lot of
heart. In between action stages, you explore towns in an
overhead perspective. There are quite a lot of hidden pickups
for your character - you can get a total of twenty hearts,
eight empty bottles, and I'm not even sure how many attack
and defense powerups. That said the game is perfectly beatable
without all that! It's silly, as befits the premise of a holy
umbrella. Hope you enjoy!

Note that your character DOES get more abilities as you play,
including the ability to run.

2.Patch History

This is a pretty old project, unbelievably so for something
so SIMPLE. I dunno quite why it took so long, but it did.
But it's done, so!

4.Known Issues
--------------
--Title screen is still in Japanese.
--There's a small issue with the Armorshark Flute item not
  erasing properly in the menu. Purely cosmetic.
--When entering the Gastric Sea area before you're supposed
  to, a scene occurs. A little bit of the area name stays
  superimposed over the character portraits.

These are all purely cosmetic and are barely noticable. Enjoy!

5.Application Instructions
--------------------------
Quick ROM Info:
2.50MB (20mbit LoROM), WITHOUT Header (*exactly* 2,621,440 bytes)
*DEINTERLEAVED* If you need to deinterleave your ROM, use NSRT.

If using ZSNES, make sure that the patch has the same name as your ROM.
In other words, if your ROM is called "umb.smc" make sure the patch
is "umb.ips" okay? If you're using a Mac, a Mac IPS patcher is
available. Check the AGTP Links page. If you're using a copier, you
probably already know how to patch the ROM :) Be sure to apply the
patch to a clean copy of the ROM, and make sure your ROM DOES NOT HAVE
A HEADER!. If you right-click the ROM and select Properties, it
should read "Size: 2.50 MB (2,621,440 bytes)".
