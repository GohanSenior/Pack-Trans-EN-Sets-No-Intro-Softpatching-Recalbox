There is 2 way of patching the ROM by using the BPS or the ASM Source

Using a BPS patcher) patch rascoonrascal.bps onto your Araiguma Rascal (Japan).sfc rom
beat was used to make the patch can also be used to apply the patch

Using Asar)
double click on Asar.exe
write "main.asm" as patch filename
write "YourRomName.sfc" as rom filename

*note YourRomName.sfc must be Araiguma Rascal (Japan).sfc rom and be careful it will be overwritten

you can edit the main.asm file if you think you can come up with a better translation
you can also edit the .bin files and .tilemap files with tools like yy-chr and tilemapstudio

feel free to update the translation or translating it into another language using this source code
