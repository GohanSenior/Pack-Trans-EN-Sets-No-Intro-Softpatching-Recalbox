1.About TwinBee Rainbow Bell Adventure
--------------------------------------
This is the first and only platformer based on Konami's TwinBee property,
and story sequel to Detana!! TwinBee (Arcade and PC Engine.) You control
TwinBee, WinBee, or GwinBee through several stages with tons of secrets
to find, plenty of humorous dialog, and six different endings. Fans of
the series will note that this was released in the UK, but had all of
its text, secrets, and all but one ending removed. It straighted out the
world map into a straight line (no more secret exits) and removed the
battery save functionality. This translation, when applied to the Japanese
version of the game, will allow the player to experience the game the way
it was originally meant to be experienced.

4.Known Issues
--------------
--The title graphics are *briefly* scrambled as the screen fades in. They
  fix themselves in a few frames, but it's noticeable.
--If you have any saves in the Japanese version of the game (SRM or savestate)
  the names of the save files on the save selection screen will be scrambled.
  This is because I've rearranged the game's 8x8 font, and the game stores the
  names of the files to SRAM. The only time they're loaded from the ROM (which
  is where my changes are) is when the game first initializes them. This is
  expected behavior; you can manually rename your files "SaveFile A" through
  "SaveFile D" using the in-game name editor, or you can delete your saves and
  start from scratch.

Please report any bugs, spelling errors, and such
on The Pantheon (http://agtp.romhack.net/pantheon)
Screenshots are preferred, as are savestates.

5.Application Instructions
--------------------------
Quick ROM Info:
1.00 MB (8mbit LoROM) WITHOUT header. (*exactly* 1,048,576 bytes)
No header.

If using ZSNES, make sure that the patch has the same name as your ROM.
In other words, if your ROM is called "twinbee.smc" make sure the patch
is "twinbee.ips" okay? If you're using a Mac, a Mac IPS patcher is
available. Check the AGTP Links page. If you're using a copier, you
probably already know how to patch the ROM :) Be sure to apply the
patch to a clean copy of the ROM, and make sure your ROM DOES NOT
HAVE A HEADER!. If you right-click the ROM and select Properties, it
should read "1.00 MB (1,048,576 bytes)". TUSH will remove all
of your headers for you easily, and you can find it at
http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/608/

An easy way to tell if the game has a header or not is that if you
apply the patch and the game does not boot, your game very likely does
not have a header.

6.Gameplay Tips
---------------
--On the world map, a red dot signifies a level you have not cleared yet.
  A gold dot signifies a level where you've found one but not all exits.
  A gray dot signifies a level where you've found all the exits, but not
  all of the secrets.
  No dot signifies that the level has been cleaned out completely.
--If you can clear a level in under the target time, the game will reward
  you with a full kit of powerups.
--Your ending rank is based entirely on your completion percentage, which
  is calculated based on fairies rescued, goals found, and doors opened.
  The little bells in each level do not count for completion percentage,
  but the counter can be useful if you're looking for a last hard-to-find
  secret.

7.Liner Notes
-------------
This isn't something I normally include with a translation, but as TwinBee
is an established series with expected terminology, and as we're deviating
from that terminology somewhat, I wanted to talk briefly about how we chose
names and the changes we made. Note that this section has some spoilers for
boss names.

-TwinBee, WinBee, and GwinBee are anthropomorphic robots. In the original
game, they AND their pilots were referred to simply as TwinBee, WinBee, and
GwinBee, with the robots themselves being specifically "Mecha TwinBee" etc.
However, in established series continuity (and, indeed, in the OVA that
Konami put out to advertise the game) the pilots each have actual names:
Light, Pastel, and Mint for TwinBee, WinBee, and GwinBee respectively. We
made the editorial decision to change references to TwinBee, etc to Light,
etc when appropriate, and shortened the one reference to "Mecha GwinBee"
to simply "GwinBee." Neither Zenki nor I are sure why the pilots aren't
named in this, but this seemed like the most appropriate course of action
givent he circumstance.

-The enemy doctor's name, in kanji, is literally "warumon" - which is what
most places (including Wikipedia and HG101, at least as of this writing)
call him. However, as none of the other names in the game are particularly
Japanese, Zenki and I thought that leaving it as a straight-up romanization
would have been doing the game a disservice. Instead, we looked at the
meaning behind the name - literally, it's basically The Bad Doctor. But that
was kind of... bland, boring, whatever. Didn't really fit! I forget who
exactly suggested it, but since he's Cinnamon's arch enemy, and given the
series's penchant for naming people after herbs and spices, I went looking
for bitter-flavored herbs, and came up with "Wormwood." Not only does it
sound somewhat sinister, it serves as a reasonable antithesis to the
friendly Cinnamon.

-The boss "ByonBee" was changed to "Boingbee" as "byon" is onomatopoeia
for the sound a spring makes.

-The boss "Pakapon" was changed to "Egghead." This is more onomatopoeia;
in this case, it describes the sound that the boss makes when cracking its
head open.

-The boss "DebunBee" was changed to "BumblBee." Again, more onomatopoeia;
in this case, it's the buzzing noise flapping wings make, which makes
sense in the context of this particular boss, which flaps its arms wildly
in an attempt to fly.

-The boss "DelnBee" was changed to "BiggBee" in reference to its size.

-The area "Hekopon Island" was changed to Sodaspring Island, again for
onomatopoeic purposes.

-The area "Kirarin Dungeon" was changed to "Sparking Caverns" - kirarin
being onomatopoeia for a sparkling noise.

-The area "Gachapoko Zone" was changed to "Toytanic Zone." Not 100% sure
on this one, but given the theme of the area (it's a giant toy fantasyland)
I was thinking that its name might be a reference to gachapon toys. Again,
not sure, but it's the best anyone could come up with!
