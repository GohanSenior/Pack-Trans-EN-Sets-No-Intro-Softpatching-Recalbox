1.About Metal Max
-----------------
Metal Max is an open, nonlinear RPG with a heavy focus on sidequests and
tank tweaking. The main game has you chasing bounty heads and finding
new vehicles for your entourage, but there's so much other stuff to do!
You can pimp your tanks with decals and accessories, you can buy furniture
and wall hangings for your home, play with little critters that eat your
money and grow to enormous proportions, or enjoy a host of minigames. Go
hunting for this week's target and become a rich and famous bounty hunter!

2.Patch History
---------------
The Metal Max project has been frought with difficulties since the very
beginning. The font is stored sideways (yes, sideways!) which presented
its own problems, the text was compressed, and the menus were a -bitch-
to work with. This thing had more bugs than I care to think about, and
its betatest took longer by many months than most. But we got there, in
the end!

November 6th, 2007 - Initial v1.00 release.

5.Application Instructions

Quick ROM Info:
4.00MB (32mbit LoROM), WITHOUT Header (*exactly* 4,194,304 bytes)

If using ZSNES, make sure that the patch has the same name as your ROM.
In other words, if your ROM is called "metalmax.smc" make sure the patch
is "metalmax.ips" okay? If you're using a Mac, a Mac IPS patcher is
available. Check the AGTP Links page. If you're using a copier, you
probably already know how to patch the ROM :) Be sure to apply the
patch to a clean copy of the ROM, and make sure your ROM DOES NOT HAVE
A HEADER!. If you right-click the ROM and select Properties, it
should read "Size: 4.00 MB (4,194,304 bytes)".

-----------------
6.Troubleshooting
-----------------
--If the game does not run at all, read the above section on
  application instructions (specifically on header removal.)
  Make sure your ROM is not read-only when you toy with it.
  Also make sure that if you previously hard-patched the ROM and
  the game crashes as described, you will need to re-apply the
  patch a clean, Japanese original ROM.
--Also note that if it looks like the text is broken in the text
  boxes, you'll need a different version of ZSNES. The game doesn't
  work in a lot of recent ZSNES versions.
