Super Aleste (Japan)
English Translation by asiwish

Japan rom is better than US/EU version with more and cuter scene pics.
Translated all Japanese words in game options and ending scene except those staff names.
Game mode "normal/hard/hyper/tricky/wild(lunatic)" are translated as "easy/normal/hard/hyper/insane" due to final score screen number of displayed charactor constraint.
