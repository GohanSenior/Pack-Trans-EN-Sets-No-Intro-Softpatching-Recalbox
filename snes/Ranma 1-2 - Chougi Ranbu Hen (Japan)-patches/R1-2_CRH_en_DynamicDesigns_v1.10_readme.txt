Game Description:

Description courtesy of Ranma Wiki - http://ranma.wikia.com/wiki/Ranma_%C2%BD:_Chougi_Rambuhen

In the story mode, the player's chosen character gets a letter explaining that they just received
the recipe to the most valuable of all treasures, the golden beckoning cat, which has the ability
to grant any wish. The character must then set out to find the 12 ingredients of the golden
beckoning cat, located all over the world, before one of their rivals does the same. 



Special features of this game.

This game has some advanced features for its time.

1. The game has three modes, story, versus and Tag Team.

2: In Tag Team, you choose 2 players and when you get to the edge of your side of the screen you can switch
   out characters using select.  This gives you a fresh character when your in a pinch.  There is a timer
   once you've swapped characters to keep you from doing it again for a short period of time, but you can do
   it multiple times a match.  Also, the character whose not active will slowly regain health while waiting
   on the sideline.

3: The game has a point scoring system and hi-score system just like many fighting games of the era.

4: The game is also one of just a few to actually feature the characters Mariko Konjo as well
   as Herb.  The game also features Hinako Ninomiya.  However, she has been featured in a few more games than
   the earlier mentioned pair.  Fans of the anime universe only will not be especially knowledgeable about
   Herb as he never appeared in the anime.  The other two did appear. Hinako was in one of the latter OVAs
   of the series.  Mariko was in the main anime series, however her hair color in the anime is brown, not
   blond as it should have been.  This makes recognizing her in the game more of a challenge.




Production and Testing:


This game's production went fairly quickly.  Bongo` asked Filler if there were some games he would
especially like to work on being that he had helped us out so many times, and this game was at the
top of his list.  Bongo` quickly hacked it and Filler did the translation and script writing.  He
started on the graphics but then asked Taskforce if he had time to do them.  Taskforce was busy but
found enough time take care of the graphic work.  Then he replaced the thin font and edited the script
to work with the new font.  Finally he beta tested the game one last time and it is now ready for release.




Patching:

Contained within this archive is an IPS (international patching system) file or a patch file in another
format for the end user's convenience that when used in conjunction with a ROM file will make the
game playable in English.

Do note that this patch is a result of countless hours of love and labor. Hence, they are not meant
to be sold at any price under any circumstance, be it in digital form or burnt into a donor cart's
ROM chip.  You may make your own cartridge for your own use, but please do not sell them to others.

To patch the ROM file, one needs to procure a patcher for their preferred format, a widely available
class of programs, many of which can be found at http://www.romhacking.net/ for one source.  A few
can even be found on our download page for your convenience at
http://www.dynamic-designs.us/downloads.shtml.  Look at the bottom under utilities.  We did not make
these utilities, we just provide them for your convenience.

At some point, ROM sites may upload pre-patched ROMs of our Ranma Hard Battle II translation.
Obviously, Dynamic Designs cannot endorse playing these versions, nor will we support resolution
of any associated problems. Moreover, pre-patched ROMs may float around the web for years.  Only
by downloading patches containing just our original work from D-D's web site may gamers obtain
revisions to these patches - if any - and take advantage of possible bug-fixes and corrections.

Below is the information pertaining to the ROM file our patch requires, according to Nach's SNES ROM
Tools:

**Also take SPECIAL NOTE that the original rom lacks a header.  You may have to remove the header
from your ROM file, but don't worry as there are a variety of programs that do this, such as
SNESTool, Smile, Toolbox, etc.  



Size before patching: 2.50 MB (2,621,440 bytes)

Size after patching: 3.00 MB (3,145,728 bytes)


Alternatively, most emulators support a feature called soft patching, which keeps the ROM file
intact, merging the patch data only during run time. To make use of it, make sure both the ROM file
and the IPS are in the same directory as your emulator of choice and have the same name, but not the
same extension. Do note that this is case-sensitive.  (Also, do note this soft patching is only
available using the IPS patch file, and may NOT work with the other patch file formats.)


e.g:  Ranma_Hard_Battle_II.smc and Ranma_Hard_Battle_II.ips will trigger soft patching at the emulator's run
time.





Emulator Compatibility:


The game behaves itself properly in a wide range of emulators such as ZSNES, SnesGT, Mednafen,
SNES9X and Higan/BSNES.





Special Thanks:


Without these people, it just wouldn't have been possible or fun: All of the great staff at D-D.
Filler for translating the game, Bongo` for hacking, Filler for writing.  Taskforce for graphics
and of course the rest of the D-D forum community!
