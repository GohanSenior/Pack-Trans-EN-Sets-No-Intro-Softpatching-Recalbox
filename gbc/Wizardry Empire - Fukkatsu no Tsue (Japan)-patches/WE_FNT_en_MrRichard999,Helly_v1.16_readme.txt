1. First download a beat (bps) patcher tool.

http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/893/
https://byuu.org/tool/beat/

This tool prevents gamers from making patching mistakes.

And it ensures the creation process worked correctly.

2. Run the beat program and apply the included bps file.

  Japan game: "Wizardry Empire - Fukkatsu no Tsue (Japan).gbc"

  !! It should be an original, unpatched rom !!

  If you get an error message, then your Japan rom is incorrect.
  Or you should re-run the beat patcher again.

  Original Japan MD5: FA8360094CAE37A838FABCFD333AE300.

3. If all goes well, you will get a successful patching message.

   Enjoy the game in an emulator or real handheld device.  

4. Caution: applying other people's hacks and addendums may
   create errors in your game. Doing so will void your complaints
   and bug reports.

5. To Wizardry fans, enthusiasts - please enjoy this group effort
   by the romhacking community.
