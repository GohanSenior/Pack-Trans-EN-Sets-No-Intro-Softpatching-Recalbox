Mobile Golf english translation
===============================

What's Mobile Golf?
-------------------
On 2001, Nintendo and Camelot released a Japan-only sequel for Game Boy Color
Mario Golf called Mobile Golf.
It can be considered an expansion: new courses, new golfers, new minigames and
even an exclusive mini-golf mode that didn't even made an appearance in later
games in the series. It doesn't have a story mode, but all RPG elements
(experience, leveling up, skill points...) for character building are still
there.
But what it made it so special was its Mobile Adapter compatibility (see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epl9prMmnGU). It was a special link cable that
allowed internet connection through a cellphone. Yes, internet connection in a
Game Boy Color game. Yes, in 2001.
There were a few games that supported it. In our case, it allowed for massive
multiplayer tournaments to be held. Participants could get amazing prizes like
special clubs for use in-game and even extra courses and characters that could
be considered DLC somehow.
