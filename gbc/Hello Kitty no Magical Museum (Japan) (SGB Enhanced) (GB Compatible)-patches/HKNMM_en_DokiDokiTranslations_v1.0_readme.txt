ABOUT THE GAME
this is a cool little puzzle game with helo kitty (:D)  i just thought
i'd do the project becuase i had a spare day and needed a break 
from big scripts ^^; anyway, it had more text than i expected and 
annoying space saving schtuff, so it took four days instead ^^;
but *i* think it was worth it :P
so all the text and graphics are translated, even the pocket printer 
stuff which no one is probably ever gonna see. hab fun kidz :P
i hacked this game listening to masami okui. ph33r.
