Q.  How do i apply the patch to the rom?
A.  Well there's two ways you can do it!, you can either use IPS.exe or SNESTL12.
both of which are DOS programs.

when using IPS.exe you simply go to the directory where the rom and ips is in (make sure
they are in the same directory) and type
IPS (romname) (IPS name)  
example : c:\games\ips magchase.gbc magchase.ips

Q.  How do i get to the directory in DOS mode?
A.  ok two things to remember in DOS mode

typing CD\   takes you back one directory
so if you are at c:\windows\  typing cd\  will take you to c:\

typing cd (foldername) takes you into a directory
so if you are at c:\  and type cd windows it will take you to c:\windows\

Also when using SNESTL12
its alot simpler
in DOS promt simply type SNESTL12
press USE IPS, select the ips and the rom game and voila~! done!

How to play
well the game has a tutorial section.. if you're too lazy to read that then i'll
repeate it here!

press the B button to shoot
push the A button and the stars will stay put..push it again to cancel
(push the A button and the stars will be in position)
push B, and then A, and the stars will shoot bullets

Modes of the game.
when first starting the game you get to choose easy, wild or hint
Easy mode is the game in easy mode
Wild mode is harder, you take more damage when hit, and enemies have more life.
Hint.. the hardest game mode!  just kidding..its a tutorial on how to play the game.

Tips.
When playing..don't worry too much about crystals..as long as you kill all or most of 
your enemies, you will have enough crystals to buy what ever you want.

Beat the game in Wild to get the better ending!
