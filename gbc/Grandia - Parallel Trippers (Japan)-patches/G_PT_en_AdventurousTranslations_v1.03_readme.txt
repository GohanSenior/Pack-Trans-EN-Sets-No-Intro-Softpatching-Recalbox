English Translation v1.03




Version 1.03: Very small again. The description for Resurrect said "fron" instead of "from", which I didn't think was a big enough mistake to warrant a new version, but then I discovered that a certain kind of synthesis (when the card that is created can't be equipped on the character but the first card selected was already equipped) resulted in a garbled message. Ths message included a rogue letter "y" which as far as I can tell wasn't being used anywhere else in the game, so I made the tile a blank space. Please let me know if you come across any blank spaces where you expected a lower case letter y, and don't forget to report any other broken text you find!


Version 1.02: Very minor edit. Fixes error text when trying to unequip an accessory you have 100 of (discovered by Rockman X), and changes the "Take quiz?" question to "Answer?" so it makes a bit more sense in both contexts in which the game calls for it.

Version 1.01: Fixes the first question asked by the platinum card girl and the message given by the card machine when the player has no gold, as reported by Rockman X. Please report any more issues you find when playing!

Version 1.00: Assumed 100% complete.



Well, this is it. Our first translation patch, 100% complete, and it's a somewhat prolific one. It's been a pretty long project, with a fair few hurdles along the way. I actually started working on this patch in about 2005, but lost the will to continue it for a long time after the hard drive it was stored on bit the dust and everything was lost. It seems Hudson REALLY didn't want anyone poking around in this game, using at least 5 different groups of compressed text, hi/lo RAM switching and various bits of data thrown around the ROM randomly, making the whole thing pretty messy. At times, that made this project feel like a lost cause. Thankfully, other Grandia fans from around the world had been interested in this translation since my old "demo" version and made plenty of progress in private. When I finally came back to it in mid-2011, new developments (particularly from malias, huge props to him) made things much easier and we were able to translate the whole thing.

The group name "Adventurous" comes from both the theme of the game series we've been working on, and the fact that I really didn't know what I was letting myself in for when taking this game on. We may translate another game some time, we may not. It all depends on which way the wind blows, I suppose. Enjoy the game, my friends. I think it has the potential to be a great multiplayer game, since it seems well balanced and you can play it online via the TGB Dual emulator. But play it however you want. It's time for us to take a rest.

DISTRIBUTION

You're free to distribute this patch however you see fit, providing that you do not charge for it, and do not provide it alongside any ROMs or other illegal materials.



   

HOW TO APPLY THE PATCH

We recommend Lunar IPS as your program for patching. If you open Lunar IPS and check "Register File Type", from there all you have to do is double click on the file name, select the untouched ROM dump from your original cartridge, and click "Open". The ROM will then be patched. If it doesn't seem to be working, your emulator may require that you shorten the ROM's file name. Visual Boy Advance users don't even need to apply the patch - just give it the same name as the ROM and the patching will be done automatically by the emulator.



FACTOIDS

Unused text includes "I saw Shirou walking away in a daze", "My Secret Collection: X" (several variants of this exist, with the End of the World, Zizun, Hell Ba-Boom, Mirage and Stapler All cards mentioned), and the quiz host catching you apparently trying to cheat (and giving you a prize for your cheek). The Pinky lover in Liete's Sanctuary also once said "It seems there are some unusual Pinky Skills! Just my advice, but... Seeds! I don't trust them!!".

Action cards 190-200 were given away at Tokyo Game Show and cannot be acquired through regular play. Nevertheless, they have still been translated.
