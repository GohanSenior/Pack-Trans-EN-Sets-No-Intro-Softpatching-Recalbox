So, uhm...yeah....Opus wanted to hack this game, EK thought it would be easy, and apparently it was...Little Magic's about a magician who wants to earn a diploma by going thorugh Lolo-esque levels...p433R my journilism skillz!

Sure, sure, If you don't know how to patch a game by this time, close this TXT file, delete all of your roms, and take up an easier hobby, like fishing.
