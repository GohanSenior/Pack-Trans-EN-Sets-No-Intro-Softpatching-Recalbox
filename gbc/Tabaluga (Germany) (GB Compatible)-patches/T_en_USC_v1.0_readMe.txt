Move over Japan, this is an untranslated *German* video game! Specifically, this Game Boy Color game tells the story of Tabaluga - one of most popular dragons in all of Deutschland.

Help Tabaluga learn to fly and breathe fire so he can protect his Kingdom of Greenland from the evil snowman Arktos' plan to cover it - IN SNOW! The stakes have never been higher. Now you can experience the thrills and *chills* in English for the first time!
