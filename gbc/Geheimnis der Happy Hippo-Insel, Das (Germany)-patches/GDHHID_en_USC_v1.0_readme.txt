How to patch:
Grab your favorite patching program (I use Lunar IPS), as well as an
unmodified German version
(Something like 'Geheimnis der Happy Hippo-Insel, Das (Germany)'.gbc).
Once you have both, open up the program, and select Apply IPS.
Select the patch (Happy Hippo Island.ips) and apply it to the original ROM.

Now you can play Happy Hippo Island...in ENGLISH!
