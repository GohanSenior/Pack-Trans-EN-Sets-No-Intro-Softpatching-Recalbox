DETECTIVE CONAN 1 (The Mechanical Temple Murder Case)
Translation by Psyklax
v1.0 (20140217)

Hi everyone! This is my first ever proper hack, but it's a big one!

If you're playing this, it probably means you already know about Detective
Conan, but just in case you don't, here's a brief synopsis:

Shinichi Kudo, a great high-school detective, is drugged and turned into an
8-year-old boy. He assumes the name Conan Edogawa and is taken in by his
girlfriend Ran Mouri (who doesn't know his true identity), living with her
and her dad, useless detective Kogoro Mouri. Since he looks like a boy,
Conan needs Kogoro to help solve crimes - he does this by knocking him
unconscious with a poison dart, then using a device to change his voice to
Kogoro's. Thus, everyone thinks Kogoro is a great detective (including
himself) while Conan remains a mere innocent young boy...

It's handy to know all this before playing, and there are a couple more
characters to know about, since you'll see them in the game.

Heiji Hattori is Kudo's rival from Osaka, and Ai Habara is another victim of
the shrinking drug. Both of them know Conan's true identity, so you'll see
Heiji referring to 'Kudo' in the game. The only other recurring character is
Inspector Megure, who often has to deal with Kogoro on murder cases.

You're all set to play, but I might as well tell you one or two more tips.

First, change the text speed to 'Hi' in the menu ASAP: it's so slow
otherwise! And in case it's not obvious, when you talk to certain
characters, a little bubble saying 'SWAP' appears. Press SELECT to swap
characters. This isn't essential to finishing the game (Conan can solve it
all on his own), but it's much more fun to see the other characters'
reactions to the case - and sometimes it can be a tad easier to use the
older characters for various reasons.

Not much else to say, other than I hope you enjoy my months of hard work!
I hope to see you again for the second game!
