Hugo GB 2 and 1/2: English Translation
Version 1.0
9 April 2021
-NikcDC

This is an updated release of the sequel to the repeatedly reskinned Hugo GB. Did this game actually deserve remastering? Apparently so!
This version adds beautiful 15-bit color, slightly improved gameplay, and a new aerial-themed mini-game - plus the same great music from the original.

Once again, keep your eye out for bags of gold as you make your way through challenges like snowboarding, log hopping, scuba-diving, and more - *three* more, to be precise. Escape from the castle and rob Scylla blind in TECHNOCOLOR!
