     Pokemon Trading Card Game 2:
       The Invasion of Team GR!

        Unofficial Translation
      v.1.0 by Artemis251, Jazz
-----------------------------------------

Welcome to my second game translation! This one was quite a lot more difficult
than my first, but hopefully things turned out just fine! I figured that since
all attempts to translate the game have gone dead, I'd take a stab at it
myself. Now, I'll admit that I really don't know Japanese, but I've done a
'best-effort' with the best online translators and context clue ad-libbing
that I could. The story isn't that deep to begin with, so it shouldn't be a
huge problem. Hopefully it'll all still seem good enough to you while you play!

Also, I will note right off the bat that this translation was developed using
Jazz's work as a basis. His ASM hack to get the English lettering workin' was
integral to getting the script manageable. Thanks much!



VERSION CHANGES
---------------
1.00 -- Initial release. (14 Jun 2012)



APPLICATION
-----------
Use an IPS patcher alongside a fresh Japanese ROM to apply the translation patch.
For reference, the Japanese ROM I used has the following checksums:

   MD5:  1134862e84110443190df460351d4575
   SHA1: a7e12bcc5f514e3aad8de570fd511aab0a308822

You likely don't have to worry about these unless you're having problems patching.
My excursions with Pokemon Emerald revealed that sometimes same-language dumps of
the ROMs sometimes exist out there, which screws up patch application. If you
tried patching and something went horribly awry, please make sure the base ROM
you're using agrees with the one I went off of!



(IMPORTANT?) NOTE:
------------------
A few areas of the game read text saved to save files. Thus, if you're using a save
file from a Japanese version of the game, a couple areas will remain untranslated for
that save game. Those areas are:

  1) Card Pop! records
  2) Challenge Machine default records

There may be others like player/deck names, too, though the latter can be fixed in-game.
These bits of info will act normally for fresh game save files, though, so I implore you
to start a new file with this patch.



SPECIAL THANKS
--------------
Jazz - As I mentioned before, he supplied a base for me to use. This base was pretty
       much the reason the English lettering could fit in so nicely.

CruxianAzelf - The only one of my beta testers to actually communicate with me! She
               caught a few typos and inconsistencies that I hadn't in my first run
               through the script.

Chewy & Tomato - Both friends of mine that I asked a question or two to about translation.
               


REMAINING BUGS
--------------
Well, this was my first bout with ASM hacking. I did fix a few things after learning
the ropes, but due to time constraints and an inability to properly fix a few things,
there are still some bugs I'm aware of. None are game-breaking, thankfully. If anyone
would like to offer solutions or their own patch to fix these, I'd be grateful!

  1) Space issues with names:
        When the game loads some text from the script, it sometimes calls additional
        entries (like card names, NPC names, decks, etc.). When these load, an
        additional space may be appended to the end of odd-length entries. The change
        is purely visual, but may end up creating a flurry of extra spaces, most notably
        in a later GR Fortress where the members name specific cards at random.
          This change is also the reason pokemon card names have double spaces when
        used in the '(name) Lv#' format. Additionally, I think it hides the card level
        for specific instances of pokemon cards with single-number levels for an
        opponent's active pokemon (in the top right of the screen while duelling).
          I'd suggest nullifying the added space, but I'm not sure what it would do
        for loading the rest of the message -- would it break the message box lineup
        or other menus?

  2) Names cannot be in lower case:
        I'm really not that experienced in ASM hacking or how Jazz set up the smaller
        lettering code. So, player names and deck names are restricted to all caps at
        the moment. It'd be great to be able to have decks with names longer than 10
        letters, for sure.

  3) Pokemon Species Info:
        This is really getting exact, but I've noticed a couple of pokemon get their
        species info from attack names instead of new text entries. This is likely
        to save space on the ROM. Those I've noticed are:

          a) Abra/Kadabra/Alakazam: should be 'Psi Pokemon', but reads its data from
                                    Golduck Lv27's first attack (Psyshock).
          b) Electabuzz/Zapdos: should both be 'Electric Pokemon', but reads its data
                                from Pikachu Lv14's second attack (Thunder Jolt).

        I may have been able to locate and fix these, but I really didn't think it was
        that important.



FINAL THOUGHTS
--------------
I hope you anjoy the game! If you find a typo or some game-crashing bug, please check
the FAQs on my site below before contacting me:

Otherwise, shoot me an e-mail at Artemis251(at)yahoo.com . Depending on whether your
issue is in this readme or on my page, I may ignore you. Harsh, yes, but if you can't
even take the time to read a couple lines below an e-mail address, I don't think I can
take the time to respond to you. Fair's fair!

In any case, I hope you have fun playing the game! Go grab your decks and start collecting!
