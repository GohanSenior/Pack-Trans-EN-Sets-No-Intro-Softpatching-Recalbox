From TV Animation One Piece - Yume no Luffy Kaizokudan Tanjou! English Translation v10 Update

I stumbled on this English translation randomly, and as far as I know, the translation is complete 
(though I have not personally played through it entirely to confirm this).

It appears to have been a translation made by someone called Star Trinket, so full credit to them.

The version of the translation before it was seemingly removed from the internet was v9.

Here is the source to v9:

v10 is a simple fix to the title screen. v9 has awful text for the subtitle of the game, so I fixed this
by converting the official One Piece font to the title screen, as such "Luffy's Dream Crew" uses a pixelated
One Piece font.

V11 - Updated the title screen again to fix missing pixel on the artwork and added some extra pixels to the subtitle.
    - Removed the japanese text from the One Piece logo on the Congratulations screen.
