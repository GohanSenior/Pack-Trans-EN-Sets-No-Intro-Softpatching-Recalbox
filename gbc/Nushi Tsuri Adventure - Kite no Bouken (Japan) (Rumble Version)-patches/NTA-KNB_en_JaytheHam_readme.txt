Release 2.0
August 2018

The only change in v2.0 is that the ROM no longer writes to memory that is inaccesible on real hardware. The patched game should now work on actual Gameboys and more accurate emulators without the text overlapping itself. This has not been thoroughly tested like v1.0, there may be problems later in the game so I've included the original patch here to. If anyone completes the game patched with v2.0 please contact me so I can update this.

Release 1.0
October 2010

All game dialogue is translated, and all the menu/system text that I could find(presumably all of it).
I only did two quick playthroughs of the translated game, so neither I nor Robert(the translator) haven seen every line of the English text in-game, there may be translations that aren't perfect or formatting errors, email me if you find anything.

The asm I wrote to double the number of characters per line doesn't seem to work on some emulators(E.g. Visual Boy Advance), use a better emulator like NO$GMB or BGB if you notice the text overlapping itself.

Some of the fish names are a bit butchered to fit in the allowed space, I extended the max length to 15 characters, but that's not long enough for a lot of the proper names, and going longer causes silly bugs in the fishing notes and when a fish is caught or escapes that would have taken far too much time to fix.
