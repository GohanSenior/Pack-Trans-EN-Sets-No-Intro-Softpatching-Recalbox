==1.0: INTRODUCTION==



"In all your journeys, have you seen
the land beyond the mountains green?"


Sylvanian Families - The Fairyland Pendant is my first complete translation patch. The full story of why I'm
working on the project is fairly lengthy and is given on my website, so I'll dispense with it.


Sylvanian Families is an RPG in the vein of games such as Harvest Moon or Animal Crossing. There are no
monsters to fight, demons to capture or worlds to save: just people to make friends with, a landscape to
explore and sidequests to uncover. There is a set objective, but you have an unlimited amount of time to
reach it, so feel free to take it easy and discover everything the game has to offer.


The game is based on a toy line which I wasn't even aware still existed until I learned about the Sylvanian
Families video games. I've done research to try and keep the material presented in the game as close to the
official English-language material as possible: all the character names have been verified as accurate, but
some locations and concepts may be somewhat different. If you have any corrections you wish to notify me of,
please contact me using the method given below.



--1.1: WHAT'S NEW--


Version 1.1 fixes numerous bugs and errors in the original 1.0 patch. Extra-special thanks to Shadowsithe
for digging up all the errors I somehow managed to miss.

Version 1.1b fixes a typo in the intro that somehow managed to remain unnoticed for six months. Special
thanks to Spinner 8 for bringing it to my attention (and apologies for being too lazy to update the
credits to reflect his contribution; I promise this will be rectified if I ever do another major update).
The checksum has also been fixed, so emulators and other programs that are designed to take note of this
(such as BGB, which was of immeasurable help in making sure the game's proportional font would work on
actual hardware) will no longer issue a complaint or warning.



==2.0: CONTENTS OF THIS ZIP FILE==



This ZIP file contains the following:

-Readme.txt (this file)
-sf1v11b.ips (the translation patch in IPS format)



==3.0: REQUIREMENTS==



First and foremost, you must have a copy of the game ROM. If you have the actual cartridge, you can (with
some technical expertise) dump the ROM yourself; otherwise, you can find the game on the Internet through
Google or other search engines. The game is common on ROM sites under the (incorrect) title of "Sylvania
Family"; searching for that title in conjunction with the word "ROM" or "ROMs" should help you find a copy
in little time. DO NOT ASK ME FOR A COPY OF THE ROM.


Sylvanian Families - The Fairyland Pendant can be played on any system that has a GBC emulator. In fact, if
you have a flash cart, you can play the game on an actual system. DO NOT ASK ME WHERE TO FIND FLASH CARTS.
(Because I don't know, either.)


You will require an IPS patch program to apply the translation patch to the ROM. These are available for
various platforms and most require no additional software installation; a quick Internet search should turn
up a plethora of them.

==5.0: KNOWN ISSUES==



-There is a sign next to the eastmost entrance to Acorn Mountain that does not display any text when examined.
This is a bug in the original game and is not a error in the patch.

-Using the warp hole between the Flower Garden and Skyblue Fields will cause an error in the Musical Bridge
minigame where asking Douglas to let you across will not move you to the proper side of the bridge. Asking him
again will put you on the correct side. This is a bug in the original game and is not an error in the patch.

-If one player cancels a trade while the link partner confirms, the confirming partner will recieve the
item put up for trade by the other player and lose the item they offered; the cancelling player's items
will remain unchanged. This is a bug in the original game and is not an error in the patch.

-The "Hanauranai Jiten" ("Flower Language Encyclopedia", or "Flower Dictionary") is not available in this
version of the translation patch. The sidequest in which you originally obtained it is still accessible,
but the reward has been altered.



==6.0: ET CETERA==



The Sylvanian Families - The Fairyland Pendant translation patch has been in the works since mid-2005. Work
was suspended for about six months, until January 2006, when I learned I could modify Klarth's Atlas to work
through the script jumps that had hung up the translation process. The continuation of the project was
primarily fueled by a sort of self-loathing resulting from my realization that I had become my worst enemy:
my original intention was to translate the game directly, without regard for the official English-language
material, and this behavior is exactly what incited me to vilify Tokyopop and Dark Horse for their
non-translations of the .hack manga and novels and Trigun, respectively. I was a hypocrite, and this
translation is my atonement for that hypocrisy.

No small part of the credit for finishing this project goes to my utility "Burn My Dread", which even in
its rudimentary, shambolic state was no end of help in ferreting out the last pesky script jumps, as well
as fixing the more serious bugs Shadowsithe encountered. Eventually I hope to expand Burn My Dread into a
full-fledged editor for the GBC Sylvanian Families games, and it may even see a public release. Keep
visiting my website for further updates!
