1.God Medicine
--------------
God Medicine is a run-of-the-mill RPG for the gameboy by Konami. It
takes a fairly unique approach to a fairly generic underlying story,
alleging that the main characters are real-world folk transported
into an RPG world. A lot of what God Medicine does has been done
before, the only really interesting twists to combat coming about
halfway through the game, but its generic-ness is precisely what
allows it to take the occasional jab at RPGs and video games as a
whole. It's a fun game though, even if it's not particularly tough.

2.Patch History
---------------
This started out a very, very long time ago, with akujin helping to
dump the script and the actual text translation going nowhere for a
while. I seem to recall someone having worked on it before Sogabe
stepped up to translate the script a few years back, but I honestly
don't remember who it was :( Anyway, long story short, Cidolfas
worked on script polishing, then the whole thing sat by the wayside
while I attempted to get text compression and/or text relocation
implemented. When both fell through (aside from the game's built-in
compression scheme) and after much deliberation I just hacked up
the script to fit in the game, and here's the final result.

November 13, 2004 - Initial version 1.00 Release

4.Known Issues
--------------
--There are quite a few instances in the Yamima monster file where
  move and magic text either runs into each other or overrides the
  window border. There's not much I can do about this at this point,
  unfortunately.

If you find any other issues, please post about them on The Pantheon.

6.Troubleshooting
-----------------
--If the game does not run at all or displays strange glitchiness
  shortly after you boot it up, make sure you're applying the patch
  to the 512KB Super Gameboy edition and not the 256KB monochrome
  release.
