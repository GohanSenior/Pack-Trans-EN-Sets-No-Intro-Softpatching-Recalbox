== Settings ===================================================================

Some... creativity was required to fit the english text on screen. Here is a description for each setting.

  1. Kuitan         - This setting controls Kuitan and Atozuke. https://riichi.wiki/Ari-ari
  2. Furiten Riichi - This rule controls permanent furiten in Riichi. https://riichi.wiki/Furiten#Permanent_furiten_during_riichi
  3. Swap on Draw   - This rule controls noten oya nagare, or swapping seats/dealers after an exhaustive draw. If this option is set to 'O', then the dealer will change if both players are in noten, or if the dealer is in tenpai.
  4. Full Game      - This controls the game length. If this is set to 'O', a full game of both East and South rounds will be played, otherwise a half-game of only the East round will be played.
  5. Tsumo Pinfu    - If enabled, pinfu can only be completed on a self-drawn tile.
  6. BGM            - Controls background music during gameplay. 'O' for on, 'X' for off.

== Opponents ==================================================================

Each of the computer controlled oppenents in Yakuman have a unique attribute.

  1. Humble Taro    - Taro is just your average mahjong player. He isn't great, but he isn't bad either.
  2. Hidden Hanzo   - Hanzo will never call Pon, Chi, or Kan. He always keeps his hand concealed (hidden).
  3. Riichi Himeko  - Himeko will go for Riichi no matter the odds. She prefers high risk/high reward plays.
  4. Weeping Joe    - Joe is quick to open his hand. He will call Pon, Chi, or Kan at the first chance.
  5. Yakuman Wizard - The Yakuman Wizard always starts with excellent hands that set him up for a Yakuman. The only way to beat him is to win early.

== Credits ====================================================================

While trawling through the code, I noticed the developers names following the word Programming. I suspect this was intended to be a basic credits screen, but as far as I can tell, the code can never be reached.
I will list the names of the developers here in the order that they appear in the code:

  - Naohiro Shiotani
  - Yoichiro Sobajima
