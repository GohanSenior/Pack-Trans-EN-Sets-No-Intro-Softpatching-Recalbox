About Glory of Heracles
======================================================
Background: 

Woo boy, this project is old. I was looking at aishsha's
website and in May 2011, he made a post about a secret
GB RPG announcement.

aishsha says he was talking about the Oni games, but I
still say it was Heracles :)
Either way, this is project is 5+ years old and boy
did it take me forever to finish.

This is as good a time as any to address the existence
of the already complete translation of this game.
aishsha and I started this translation when that
translation project looked like it would never be
finished. While we were in the middle of working on
this project, that other project finished before
us. However, we noticed several cosmetic limitations
and that the script had to be squeezed into the original
space. Considering that, we decided to continue with
our work knowing that we could do a much better job
with the translation.

This game was translated from scratch by aishsha while
I did all the hacking. I can't speak much for the
translation details, but I was able to accommodate a
much larger script without much cuts, if any.
I coded a super complicated DTE routine and moved
some text to another bank. That was all fairly
challenging, but it was the menus that were hell
to deal with. Expanding and moving various menus were
fairly easy, but when it came to stuff related to
items, the hacks involved were stuff of nightmares.
The game originally featured 2 columns of item names
side by side for a character limit of 8.
I hacked everything to display only 1 column, thus
doubling the character limit to 16 and getting all the
various screens to play nice was a bitch.

The game also liked to print the name of character
speaking on the same line as the dialogue, which
when you have a name like Aphrodite, it just didn't
mix well with the GB's small screen. So that was also
hacked be displayed elsewhere.

Those were the biggies, but also at aishsha's behest,
I hacked the treasure chest text box to behave normally
as it had some weird awkward behavior originally.

Once I got most of that crap out of the way, I began
my playtest and edit of the script, which took me
several years to finish due to real life and other
projects. Then my testers got ahold of the ROM and
finished the game in only a few days. I guess that's
just how this stuff goes...

Special mention to DvD for hacking and designing the
title screen. rainponcho for some misc hacking help
late in the project's life.
Ryusui, harmony7, Eien ni Hen and TheMajinZenki for their
invaluable spot translation and editing help.

Included with the patch is an image of the game's map
from the manual. The original version can be found here:

danke has graciously photoshopped that up and given us an English
version to release with the translation. This map might come in
handy.

P.S.

Support the game industry by buying used games!

Even if the money doesn't go to the developers
directly, as the games become rare and harder
to find, the price goes up, and people become
more inclined to buy new releases "while they can!"
