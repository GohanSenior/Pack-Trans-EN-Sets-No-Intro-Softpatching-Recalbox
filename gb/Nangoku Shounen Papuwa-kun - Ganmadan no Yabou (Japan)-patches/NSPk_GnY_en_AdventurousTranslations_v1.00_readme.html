Version 1.00: The company names and title screen have now been translated thanks to compression tools provided by rainponcho.
This means that the game is now 100% translated!<br><br>

Version 0.98: Initial release. The only things that haven't been translated are the splash intro screen with the company names,
and the title screen. This is because all of the large images in the game are compressed, and I don't have the necessary skills
to edit them. If anyone reading this is able to do crack the compression, or find a workaround for it, please let me know.<br><br><br>

</font></p><p><font face="Tahoma">Nobody asked for a translation patch for this game. I'm well aware of that. However, it's actually quite an enjoyable game
that I think more people should give a chance. Since it's based on a 90s comedy manga/anime that was fairly popular in Japan, but
pretty much unknown to the rest of the world, chances are you didn't download this because you're a fan of the series. If you're
familiar with Nangoku Shounen Papuwa-Kun, it's probably because you've seen (or maybe even played!) the fan translation of the Super
Famicom game. Personally, I think that this Game Boy game - which is <i>completely</i> different - is much better than that one.

</font></p><p><font face="Tahoma">I don't really have any stories about the hurdles this game presented during the translation process. There's a bit of
weirdness with it ignoring a specified string length for "Password" on the main menu, and the "The End" graphic caused some
headaches (try checking that out in Tile Layer Pro and making sense of it), but that's about it, really.

</font></p><p><font face="Tahoma">When will Adventurous release another translation? Maybe when the blue sea calls, the white waves sing, and Arashiyama
makes a friend under the bright red sun. Until then, enjoy this one!

</font></p><p align="left"><font face="Tahoma"><b><u>DISTRIBUTION</u></b>
</font></p><p><font face="Tahoma">You're free to distribute this patch however you see fit, providing that you do not charge for it, and do not provide
it alongside any ROMs or other illegal materials.<br><br><br>

</font></p><p align="center"><font face="Tahoma"><img src="images/2.png" width="40%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/3.png" width="40%">

</font></p><p align="left"><font face="Tahoma"><b><u>HOW TO APPLY THE PATCH</u></b>
</font></p><p><font face="Tahoma">We recommend <a href="http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/240/">Lunar IPS</a> as your program for patching. If you open
Lunar IPS and check "Register File Type", from there all you have to do is double click on the file name, select the
untouched ROM dump from your original cartridge, and click "Open". The ROM will then be patched. If it doesn't
seem to be working, your emulator may require that you shorten the ROM's file name. Visual Boy Advance users don't even
need to apply the patch - just give it the same name as the ROM and the patching will be done automatically by the
emulator.<br><br><br>

</font></p><p align="left"><font face="Tahoma"><b><u>FACTOIDS</u></b>
</font></p><p><font face="Tahoma">Sorry, no unused text or weird real-life events relating to the game to speak of this time. Although you should probably
stay away from the "Nbaba Love Song" opening for the original Papuwa anime, it's highly addictive.<br><br><br>
