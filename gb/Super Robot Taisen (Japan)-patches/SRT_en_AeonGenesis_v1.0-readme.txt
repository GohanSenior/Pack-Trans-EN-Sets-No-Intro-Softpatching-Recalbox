1.About Super Robot Wars
------------------------
The game that started it all! Super Robot Wars is a mecha crossover
strategy/RPG. You get units from various Mazinger, Getter Robo, and
Gundam TV shows all joining together to battle the evil Girgilgun,
a world-destroying monster. There's really not much more to it than
that, although interestingly SRW1 is one of the few SRW titles to
support multiplayer.

2.Patch History
---------------
I started working on this... yesterday. Sort of. It's inherited work
from strag0, who started on it many years ago, did a bunch of stuff,
and released a "version .7" which was really only maybe 15-20% complete.
In that respects some menu expansion had been done (although more had
to be done before the patch could be considered complete.) I fixed up
the unit and weapon lists - there were an awful lot of poor translations
in there - and got the remaining text translated. It turned out that
there was quite a lot of it, not just the Japanese story strag0 sent me
a month or two ago. There was a fair chunk of system text, item and
spirit move lists, and about 20K of combat text. Got that all taken
care of though, and it looks a whole lot better now than it did before.

May 20, 2007 - Initial Version 1.00 release.

4.Known Issues
--------------
--Occasionally in unit selection a unit's name will be too long
  for the screen, and the end of it will get overwritten by another
  unit or will run off the edge of the screen. Purely cosmetic.

such on The Pantheon (http://donut.parodius.com/agtp)
Screenshots are preferred, as are save games.
