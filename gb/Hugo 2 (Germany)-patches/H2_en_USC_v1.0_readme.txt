Hugo GB 2: English Translation
Version 1.0
7 September 2020
-NikcDC

Another German-exclusive Game Boy title has been translated for English-speaking audiences! Help the Scandinavian troll Hugo - last seen in Bugs Bunny: Crazy Castle 2 (...in Europe, anyway) - escape the evil Scylla's own magic castle. Fortunately, all Hugo needs to do to earn his freedom is compete in some mini-games. Unfortunately, the wicked witch has made these games range from mildly to extremely frustrating to play - but hey, at least the music's good!

Keep your eye out for bags of gold as you make your way through challenges like snowboarding, log hopping, scuba-diving, and more - two more, to be precise. Escape from the castle and rob Scylla blind in the process!
