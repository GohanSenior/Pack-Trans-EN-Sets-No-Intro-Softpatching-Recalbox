About Daruman Busters
======================================================
Background: 

I first found out about this game when I was browsing
through games made by Birthday, a dev I had a hand in
translating some of their games. The fact that it
contained very little text made it even more
appealing, but this game was nothing more than
paid advertising for Fujiya company, a company
that produces baked goods. Peke and Poko are their
mascots in fact.

As for Daruman, the name is derived from the Dharma/
Daruma doll, which is a part of Japanese culture.
The Darumen in the game actually kind of remind of
those mucus from the Mucinex commericals. So if I
were ever localize the title, maybe I'd go with
Little Debbie's Mucinex Busters :D

I guess it's pretty challenging as far as puzzlers
go and gets harder as you progress. I was able to
get around halfway done with the game and then
I cheated for the rest.

Patching Instructions
======================================================
The patch is in standard IPS or in BPS format and if
patching with BPS you need to download
byuu's beat patcher before the patch can be applied.

Apply the patch to the Japanese version of the game:

Peke to Poko no Daruman Busters.gb

We would be highly grateful, if you find some time to 
contact us with proposals or corrections. Information
on found bugs or corrections would be highly 
appreciated. I would like to point out that some of the
text relating to searching and finding stuff might not
work properly. I would love for someone to help confirm
this for me.

P.S.

Support the game industry by buying used games!

Even if the money doesn't go to the developers
directly, as the games become rare and harder
to find, the price goes up, and people become
more inclined to buy new releases "while they can!"
