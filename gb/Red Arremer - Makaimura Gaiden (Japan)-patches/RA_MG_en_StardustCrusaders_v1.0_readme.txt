About Firebrand: A Ghosts 'n Goblins Tale
======================================================
Project History:

Several years back I decided to retranslate the Japanese
version of Gargoyle's Quest for the GB. I can't really recall
why I decided that, but a translator translated the script
for me and I never did anything with it. Fast foward like
five years later and I decided to start work on this game
and finish it. All said, it only took me about a month to
do.

I guess the moral of the story is that if I'm working on
a translation with someone, I'll eventually finish it,
no matter how long it takes. Sometimes real life and
other projects get in the way, but once I start a project,
I always see it through. I must give credit to the
translator for a doing a very thorough job and providing me
with notes to consult. I don't think he's translated
many games, but he's very talented and I wish him all
the best.


The game's titular character, Red Arremer, has been
given the name Firebrand instead to match the official
translation. That wasn't the only reason. The name Red
Arremer was initially just a placeholder. Capcom had the
artwork and no name for it, someone thought the demon
look like a red version of a dev called Arima and the name
stuck. Also, the race of gargoyle's are called Red Arremer
too. So I thought Firebrand was the best option.

Speaking of the original. I had a brief look at the translation
and man is it woefully abbreviated. Painfully so and this
new translation blows it out of the water.

It isn't too bad for a GB game, so I hope you enjoy
the translation.

Patching Instructions
======================================================
Due to limitations in the IPS format and the changes I
made to the ROM, I'm only supporting the BPS for this
game. You can download FLIPS from here:

Apply the patch to the Japanese ROM:

Red Arremer - Makai Mura Gaiden (Japan).gb

We would be highly grateful, if you find some time to 
contact us with proposals or corrections. Information
on found bugs or corrections would be highly 
appreciated.

P.S.

Support the game industry by buying used games!

Even if the money doesn't go to the developers
directly, as the games become rare and harder
to find, the price goes up, and people become
more inclined to buy new releases "while they can!"
