TNT is a game where you and Philip, a tiny Sun (huh) make flowers grow. Yep.

[Gameplay]
The basic idea is to press A when you are on a line with Philip (who roams
around the perimeter of he map), with a flower bud in between you, to send out
a ray of sunshine to make a flower bloom. Or, if there's something else
in between Philip and you, the ray knocks out the offender temporarily.
The little ray of sunshine that Philip sends out has a length
determined by the heart meter at the bottom of the screen. You are also on a
timer, which is shown on the bottom right.

[Instructions]
1. Use your favorite IPS patcher to apply tnt-patch.ips to a copy of TnT.
2. Play.
