NOTES:  As far as I know this is a 100% final, but as usual should the need
arise I will update if there are problems/bugs.  This 1.11 release simply
contains a thicker font, which was replacement request.  Looks nicer.

Please support Hudsonsoft games, and even e-mail them with requests for
retail versions of their great console wargame line.  (Nectaris, Neo Nectaris

Thanks to : Omi, Spinner 8, The Crash gang, Sitc, ABEG, Flavio, Hudsonsoft,
