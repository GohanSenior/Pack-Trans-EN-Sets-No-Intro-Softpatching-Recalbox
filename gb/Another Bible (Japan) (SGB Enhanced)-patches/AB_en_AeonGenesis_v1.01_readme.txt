1.About Another Bible
---------------------
Another Bible's a strategy-RPG game based loosely on the
Megami Tensei series. It's based roughly in the Megami Tensei
Gaiden: Last Bible universe (see Revelations: The Demon Slayer
for an official United States localization of Last Bible.)

2.Patch History
---------------
Script got dumped back in July. Got a bunch of it done back
then thanks to AndrewT, then it just sorta up and died. After
Live A Live's release, I gave the scripts over to Nora who'd
worked on the Medieval chapter, and it got done. Yay.

April 19, 2002 - Initial version 1.00 Release
April 20, 2002 - Version 1.01 Release
                 Fixed a bug which caused Map 1's text to not
                 display.
