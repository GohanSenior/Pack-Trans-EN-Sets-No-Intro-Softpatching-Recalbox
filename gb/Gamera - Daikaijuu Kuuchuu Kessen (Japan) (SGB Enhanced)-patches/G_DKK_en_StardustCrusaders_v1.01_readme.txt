About Gamera
======================================================
Project History:

I had stumbled upon this game years and years ago tinkering
around with various GB games. This game stuck out to me
mostly because it was a cash-in released around the same
time as a Gamera reboot movie that was the first in a trilogy
of movies. Having loved the trilogy of movies, which this
hacker considers some of the best kaiju movies, I had a
personal interest in wanting to translate the title.
So, I dumped the text and tucked everything away until
the stars eventually aligned.

Years later, I mentioned this game to Tom as something
I would like to translate. Then out of the blue, Tom
starts playing the game and mentions it to me. So, I
send him the scripts and the rest is history.

It was a fairly straight-forward project that perhaps
was only about a month or so of work. There were a
number of graphics that complicated matters, but thanks
to hard work and patience of FlashPV, we were able to
get past all that.

As for the game itself, it's relatively short and simple.
It belongs to an odd genre that emerged from the 90s that's
basically best described as a cinematic fighter.
It's certainly not for everyone, but I found the game's
graphic design to be pretty impressive for a GB game.

Tom's comments
======================================================
Hey, Gamera fans. I'm Tom, a hobbyist fan translator who
provides American English translations of Japanese games.
This isn't the type of genre I'm usually into, but when I
checked the game out, I figured it wouldn't be too much
trouble. Mostly, I just wanted to help Pennywise out for
making some of my other dream projects happen.
I'm a casual fan of Gamera, so I was familiar with some of
the characters and events that were featured in the game, too.

I personally thought it was interesting how the developers
didn't use the typical battle feed, rendering it instead as
live commentary given by a television news reporter. I hope
the translation is still able to convey this to the player,
considering the relatively limited amount of screen space.

There were also some surprises, like special moves with names
rendered as graphics rather than plain text. It's always a
pleasure having FlashPV work on the graphics, and Pennywise's
hacking is spot-on, too.

Aside from that, it was a fairly standard project. With all of
that said, Gamera is the star of this game, not the script.
Still, I hope that this translation patch serves its purpose
and makes the game easier to play and understand.

contact us with proposals or corrections. Information
on found bugs or corrections would be highly

P.S.

Support the game industry by buying used games!

Even if the money doesn't go to the developers
directly, as the games become rare and harder
to find, the price goes up, and people become
more inclined to buy new releases "while they can!"
