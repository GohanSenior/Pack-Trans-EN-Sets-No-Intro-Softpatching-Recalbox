Penta Dragon
English Translation Patch - version 1.00 02/28/03
By HTI  http://hti.rpgclassics.com


What You'll Need:
-----------------
1. This patch you just downloaded
2. A Game Boy Penta Dragon ROM
3. SNESTool


What You'll Need To Do:
-----------------------
After you've downloaded the ROM, this patch, and SNESTool, put them all into
the same directory.  Backup the ROM if you wish, then run SNESTool, select
"Use IPS", then select "penta.ips", then your ROM.  The ROM is now patched,
so run it in your favorite emulator.


Boring Patch History:
---------------------
After finishing the menus for Glory of Heracles: Snap Story, I didn't really
have anything to do until the script got translated.  So I began looking for
a small project I could do in the meantime.  I found Penta Dragon, and it
looked interesting enough, so I decided I'd do it if I found a translator.

One of the people who offered to help me translate GoH: SS also was willing
to do Penta Dragon as a warm up.  So he did, and I inserted it, and it was
done.

The game consists of three different cut-scenes, one at the beginning, one
right before the final boss, and the ending.  Even though I kinda doubt
that many people will ever actually play the game through to the ending, it
is indeed fully translated.
