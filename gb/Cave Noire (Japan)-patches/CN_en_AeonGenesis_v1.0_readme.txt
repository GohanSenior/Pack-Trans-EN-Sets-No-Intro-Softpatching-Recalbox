1.About Cave Noire
------------------
Cave Noire is a bit difficult to pidgeonhole into any particular genre
classification. It's most similar to roguelikes; dungeons are somewhat
randomized, there's a heavy emphasis on player improvement and strategy
instead of just grinding experience, and it's very easy to die. It's
also sort of a puzzle game, as you don't gain levels in the traditional
sense at all and it's to your great advantage most times to learn how
to avoid enemies instead of trying to plow your way through them.
There's also no guessing game to play with items; everything you pick
up is immediately "identified" and comes from a very small list of
tools.

There are several types of objectives with ten levels of increasing
difficulty each, for a total of 40 variations to explore. And some of
those later ones get very, very difficult!

2.Patch History
---------------
Cave Noire was started one weekend about a month ago with the hope and
expectation of it being a very quick project. It wasn't. It was a huge
pain in the butt, all told; the single short string in the second
ending took me a good hour to hack and involved some incredibly dicey
stuff. Data compression abound too. Real nasty.

February 14, 2011 - Initial V1.00 Release
