INTROUCTION
***********
Explore the Castle Ayakashi and the temples of four mystical Japanese monsters.

This is a dungeon crawler for the Game Boy.
A rather simple early release but quite fun.

This patch is a beta patch.
It translates all the text, but there may be some bugs and such I missed.

 - Programming modifications, tools, translations
It's been so long I can't recall, I think this was a machine-aided translation.
I think filler helped with some spell stuff and the RHDN forum helped with fixing some stuff as well
as the ending.

PATCHING INSTRUCTIONS
*********************
This is a BPS patch.
Use Beat to apply it.

EMULATION ISSUES
****************
This will probably work on most emulators, but I recommend bgb, ideally with accuracy settings on.
This is an MBC2 game, and I've worked on a few of those to know they sometimes have trouble with the SRAM
on that mapper.
