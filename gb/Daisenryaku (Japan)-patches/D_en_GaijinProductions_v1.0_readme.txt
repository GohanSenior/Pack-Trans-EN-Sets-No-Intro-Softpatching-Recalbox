Translation notes.
I'm a big Daisenryaku fan, I was surprised that there was a gameboy
version (there's a Daisenryaku for almost every console made).
this version plays a bit differently.. I thought it'd be a neat and
easy translation.. 
This is the first translation I've fully completed, also the fastest
I started work on it a bit over a week ago.
However there were still problems, mainly with fonts that displayed
sprites in some areas, and text that you'd probably never see
when playing, but we fixed the font problem, and as for the text...
we just translated it anyways.  
If there's any bugs or text thats not translated (there shouldnt be)
then email me at
guardian_d@yahoo.com

Also enclosed in this Zip file is a game faq, think of it as a mini
strategy guide.  If you enjoyed this game be sure to check out

I'm also currently working on the Snes version..however don't expect
it to be released soon =P

other Daisenryaku?
the only official Daisenryaku game that's translated is the Saturn
version which came over to the US as Iron Storm, this one is set in
ww2.  I've also had thoughts of translating the Genesis Daisenryaku
(both modern and ww2 versions), and even the Saturn versions.
A playstation version exists but I haven't had the oppurtunity
to purchase one.  well thats all folks!
