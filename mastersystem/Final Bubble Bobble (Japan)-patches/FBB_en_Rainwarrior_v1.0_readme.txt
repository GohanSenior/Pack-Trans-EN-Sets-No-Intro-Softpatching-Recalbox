Patch for ROM:
Final Bubble Bobble (Japan).sms
CRC 3EBB7457


This patch translates all the Japanese text from Final Bubble Bobble.
This is an improvement over the European version in the following ways:
- The hints system is restored and translated, allowing you to discover secrets as intended.
- The translation of the animated cut-scenes has been improved.
- The Japanese food items are retained in their original form.

Source code for the patch and translation is contained in the src/ folder.

Additional credit to Bluesun and Penta Penguin for providing an initial translation of the hints at TCRF, and dot_lvl for helping with a tricky cutscene line.
