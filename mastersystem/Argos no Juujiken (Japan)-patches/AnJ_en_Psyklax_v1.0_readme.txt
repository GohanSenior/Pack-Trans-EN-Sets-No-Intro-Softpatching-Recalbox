INTRO
This patch replaces the title screen of Argos no Juujiken on
the Sega Master System with the title from the arcade game
Rygar, on which this port is based. The colours have been
reduced to match the Master System's palette, but the title
itself is a pixel-perfect representation. The patch expands
the ROM to fit the extra graphics in, and the logo takes
slightly longer to appear on-screen due to the extra
graphics tiles required.

FINAL THOUGHTS
This is my first SMS hack, and obviously title screen hacks
are among the easier hacks around. This was even easier in
that I didn't even need to design a new title: I just copied
the one from the Rygar arcade game. I was surprised at how
easy it was to expand the ROM on the SMS, so I decided to do
it since there appear to be no ill effects. The only minor
problem is that, due to the game loading more graphics tiles
into memory, the music has to wait a little longer during
the loading, so it sounds a little odd. Admittedly, the
original game has a slight pause too, but now the pause is
longer. But I think it's a small price to pay for a nice
logo!

To convert the colours, I made a new palette in GIMP which
matched the SMS palette - that is, two bits for red, green
and blue components, for a total of 64 colours. You can
display quite a few on-screen at a time of those, but GIMP
calculated which colours would be necessary for an
approximation of the colours of the logo, and I made a new
in-game palette with those colours and stuck the graphics
in. I was rather pleased with the results: it's a lot easier
than the kinds of graphical tricks necessary to get good
colour on the NES.

I'm sure I'll manage some SMS translations in future, but
this was a good bit of practice nonetheless. Enjoy!

Tools I used for this translation:
MEKA (the best Master System emulator for debugging)
HxD (general hex editing)
Tile Molester (graphics)
GIMP (for converting the title colours)
