	Shadow Dragons and the Blade of Light

		 Retranslation 2021


	This is a complete translation of Fire Emblem:
Shadows Dragon and the Blade of Light (a.k.a. Dark Dragon and
the Sword of Light, Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light,
Ankoku Ryuu to Hikari no Tsurugi, etc.) created from scratch
by Polinym.

	Translation-wise, this patch features original translation
by Polinym, with much of the phrasing and dialogue based on the
Mystery of the Emblem Book 1 translation by RPGuy96 and VincentASM.
(Monshou hack: https://www.romhacking.net/translations/961/)
(Script reference: https://serenesforest.net/mystery-of-the-emblem/scripts/)

	All of the text was checked against the original Famicom version for accuracy,
and some edits were made to that end. Some portions, especially the text absent from 
Mystery of the Emblem, are original translations by Polinym (with the previous 
fan-translation by Quirino and official Switch "translation" used for reference).

	Regarding names and termonology, this translation aims to remain faithful
to Shouzou Kaga's original Japanese creation while using official termonology where
accurate and appropriate. Examples:

Japanese	Polinym's Translation	Official Localization

MARUSU		Mars			Marth

RIFU		Wryf			Wrys

BIRAKU		Biraku			Vyland

RERAIBUnoTSUE	Relive (Staff)		Mend (Staff)		

ARITIA		Aritia			Altea

DEBIRUMOUNTEN	Devil Mountain		The Ghoul's Teeth			

kurokishidan	Sable Order		Sable Order

BOHA		Boah			Boah

GATO		Gatoh			Gotoh			

	In the name of accuracy, this translation does also not alter the
bits of "Engrish" text (except fixing the names of characters).

	In comparison to the other fan-translations for this game, this hack features
expanded text boxes to fit more text in and thus be more accurate.

	This hack has been tested to ensure that no bugs occur. However, it is possible
that I, Polinym, may have missed a line. I reccommend that you use save states at each
chapter if possible, because the game may crash if it encounters an incorrect pointer.
You should be able to beat the game with no issues. Also, chapter names in the
ending are shortened due to restrictions. The epilogue endings for each character
got a bit mixed up, too, but should work fine.

	This patch is to be applied to a clean original Japanse ROM of
		Fire Emblem: Ankoku Ryu to Hikari no Tsurugi.
