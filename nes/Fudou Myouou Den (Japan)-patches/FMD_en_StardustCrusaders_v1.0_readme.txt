1.About The Acala Legend
------------------------------
Acala was a game that was released in America in a heavily watered-down form. The removed a bunch of stages, spells etc. and there's no more cool Buddhist intro/outro. This is now fixed of course.

You will notice that the intro flickers a tiny bit. There is nothing I can do about because it's a hardware limitation. Find anything else wrong with the game, please let me know.
