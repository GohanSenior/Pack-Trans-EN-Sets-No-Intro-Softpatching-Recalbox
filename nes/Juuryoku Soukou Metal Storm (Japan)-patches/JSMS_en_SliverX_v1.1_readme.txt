About
~~~~~
This is a 100% complete translation of 
Juuryoku Soukou Metal Storm, which is the japanese
release of the game called "Metal Storm" in North America.

The japanese version has a cinematic intro and text during
the final boss fight. The difficulty is also slightly higher
due to minor level design differences.

Note that the extremely akwardly phrased ending text was already
english in the original game: Don't blame us!

Usage
~~~~~
This translation was based on the ROM known as
"Juuryoku Soukou Metal Storm  (Japan)" in the
No-Intro NES set (MD5: 1E75D6EAE4E0DC8F60F25429BE84D06F)

Usage with any other dump of the game may result in errors/issues.

Changes
~~~~~~~

v1.1

Split the translations into two patches: One with the original
color palettes, the other with the North American release's.

v1.01

Increased intro screen duration for easier reading.

Switched all palettes to USA versions, except for the first
boss (Gets a color for it in a very odd manner).
