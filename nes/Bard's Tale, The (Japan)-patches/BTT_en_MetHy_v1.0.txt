     General Info:


This patch is a translation from Japanese to English of the Famicom version
of The Bard's Tale - Tales of the Unknown.

This game did release in English in the US but with a ROM of half the size.
As a result a LOT of content was cut or changed. Almost 30 enemy types were cut,
including 3 bosses, and most of the remaining ones recycled graphics from
other enemies rather than having their own like in the original version.
A lot of dungeon graphics and graphical scenes were also cut as well as the 
intro, step sounds, some flavour text, etc. A lot of musics were also changed.
For a sample of what was cut and changed you can check the TCRF page.

This romhack took the US version script and inserted it in the JPN version.
For text that didn't exist in English I used the help of a Japanese speaker
and of Google Translate.
Note that many strings aren't 1:1 with the US release, but the meaning
always remain the same. This is due to technical reasons, also the US script
wasn't always perfect.

     Playing tips:

- You can and should use the US version manual.
- There are 2 optional bosses that were cut from the US release, it's up
to you to find them!
- Protip 1: outside of combat you can change how many party members are in
the front row with the Advance command.
- Protip 2: many monsters can be made to join your party, either using the
Bard's song or by casting the Figurine spell. Experiment!
- Enjoy! Even players familiar with the US release will have some surprises!
