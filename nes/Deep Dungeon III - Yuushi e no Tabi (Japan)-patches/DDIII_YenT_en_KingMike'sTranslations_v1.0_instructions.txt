Deep Dungeon III - The Journey to Become a Hero

This isn't really an exact translation of the manual, but it should be generally the same
information, to help you play the game better.

INTRODUCTION
------------

Guided by an unseen force, the legend of the traveling swordsman begins anew...

The Departure

Within a small village, there was a young man.
He grew up hearing the legend of the swordsman Ral.
He had dreams that someday he would become a great swordsman.
As the years went on, he grew to be a strong young man.
He left his village in hopes of being a swordsman.
After a few days of traveling, he arrived a bit weary in the nation of Dileej.
He stopped for the night at the inn in the town of Huma.
Though it might have been destiny that stopped him in the town of Huma.

The Disaster

The man feel into a deep sleep as soon as he settled in his bed.
That evening, a storm suddenly swept around Dileej.
An ominous cloud enveloped the skies above while a raging thunder roared.
The villagers huddled until dawn while a heavy downpour slammed their windows.
The next morning, the man awoke to the sound of the villagers.
From his window, the man could see the town had strangely changed since yesterday.
After leaving the inn, he could no longer faintly see the neighboring town he could yesterday.
A very high wall now dominated the landscape.
This wall that came out of nowhere completely surrounded and isolated the town.

The Fright

The villagers were stuck in awe as they heard a sudden scream.
An injured man crawled out from the entrance to the underground on the north side of town.
Breathing heavily, the man muttered "Below here, there are many great monsters!
Together, they'll destroy us.
We can't go any further.
Someboday save this town, this country..."
The town chief heard and said "Long ago, for excavating the ruins,
an artificial underground center was created.
These stairs led to it."
Down these stairs is the only passage between the town of Huma and the outside world.

The Decision

There was a strange atmosphere among the villagers.
"At this rate, we and our country are ruined."
"Isn't there anyone who can save our country?"
"Isn't there a courageous young man out there?"
Among the whispers, one voice buzzers to answer the villagers' prayers, "Allow me to go!"
That voice threw a ray of light into the still darkness.
That man who stood there, that was HIM, the traveling man.
And this begins this story...

-------------------------------
Summary of the nation of Dileej
-------------------------------

Dileej, led by King Sherman IV, rules over three towns (Huma, Isle and D'Elba), taking it from a small nation to large and prosperous.
With its ancient ruins, this kingdom has many landmarks, especially the underground city connecting Huma and Isle, the tower rising in Isle.
Those are some of the exemplary models of Dileej architecture.
The king's castle is to the south of D'Elba.
Currently, the three cities are separated by an unknown wall.
As seen in the lower figure, it is impossible to go between the three.
Also, the villagers tales speak of a house between Isle and D'Elba...

Character Introductions
-----------------------

Protagonist (swordsman)
Master of the sword.
He can't use magic, but can use almost all weapons except projectiles.
His health grows rapidly as he gains experience.

Hunter
She excels at handling projectiles.
After taking down far-away targets, she can learn a few spells as well.

Priest
He can effortlessly use the magics of life.
Because he is relatively inexperienced fighting,
repeating attacking and casting magic would be an effective strategy.

Magician
Because her combat ability and health will remain low as she gains experience,
she should show off her learned magic in emergenices against many enemies.

COMMAND MENU
------------

  To give an item to another character use "Pass", to drop something choose "Discard".
  After confirming the command, choose who, what to use, what to do with it, who to use it on.

   Class
   Experience Level

   Status. If nothing is displayed, the character is normal.
  The message window will display the amount of EXP needed to advance a Level.
 Speak
  Use when you would like to speak with allies.

 Whenever you get a weapon or protective item, you must put it on with the Item "Use" command.
 Just having it isn't enough.

  After gaining a Level, you will be able to allocate 2 extra points to Strength, Agility or Luck.
  Use Up or Down to choose a stat, A to raise the stat one point, B to drop it, and Start to confirm.

 And now, for those who've read this much, a SUPER SECRET PROTIP!
 The original didn't bother to explain the stats, but I will.
 Strength: affects physical damage done to enemies.
 Agility: affects several things: Hit rate (average of Attack and Agility), Evasion (average of Defence and Agility)
   Also influences turn order to a small degree. Higher Agility should also reduce damage from traps.
 Luck: Adding extra Luck points affects the Deathblow rate and ability to dodge traps.
  It also affects the Escape success rate.

 There are also two hidden stats: Magic Attack and Magic Resistence.
 Magic Attack is determined by max MP and increases magic damage and success rate
 Magic Resistence is determined by remaining MP. So, with lower MP you will be more vulnerable to spells.

------------
BATTLE SCENE
------------
 Fight
   Character attacks an enemy with the equipped weapon.
   For the most part, you can only attack enemies in the front row.
   But projectile weapons can hit any enemy.

 Defend
   You won't make any action during the turn,

   You can also use this to equip a weapon or armor during battle,
   but you won't be able to attack the same turn.

   from the enemy.
