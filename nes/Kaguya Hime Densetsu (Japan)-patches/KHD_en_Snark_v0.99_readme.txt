The Moon Princess is a Famicom game based loosely upon 
The Legend of the Bamboo Cutter, an ancient science 
fiction tale from Japan. In this game, you seek the 
hand of the Moon Princess and a magical orb guarded by 
a fierce dragon, while sauntering through silly side-quests
and other goofy adventures. This is a text and graphics 
adventure game with minor side-scrolling arcade sequences.
