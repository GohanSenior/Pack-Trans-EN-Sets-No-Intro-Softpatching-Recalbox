Mickey Mouse III - Dream Balloon translation

Once upon a time there was a series of Mickey Mouse games on the original Nintendo. Most were translated faithfully, but a few were altered due to licensing agreements. Mickey Mouse III - Dream Balloon (aka: Yume Fuusen) was one such game - in English-speaking countries it was called "Kid Klown", with (in my opinion) rather hideous graphic changes and a completely different story.
This patch translates the game into English, so you can see what Disney felt they weren't being paid enough in 1992 to show you.
(*Yes there's a prototype version that was translated, but the English was pretty terrible*)




v1.1
--------
*Translated 'Hard Mode' winning message (didn't realized it changed!)
*Fixed a few typos and alignment issues

Possible Future Updates?

*Add lowercase letters
**************

How to patch:
Get a copy of the Japanese "Mickey Mouse III - Yume Fuusen" rom, choose the correct patch for that version, and an IPS patching program (Lunar IPS seems to be the standard).
Run the program, click 'Apply patch', and viola! Enjoy.
