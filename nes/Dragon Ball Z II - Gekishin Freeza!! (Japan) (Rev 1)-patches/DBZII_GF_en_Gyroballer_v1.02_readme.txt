1. Introduction

-------------------------------------------------

DBZ II for the Famicom is a card-based RPG and
the sequel to DBZ: Assault of the Saiyans.
The game improves upon its predecessor by
starting you off with 5 Z-Fighters and it's a
lot less of a grindfest. Besides the powerup Guru
gives to the warriors on Namek, you can train on
Goku's gravity ship during the final showdown with
Freeza. Additionally, you can input the 7
passwords from the first game to start with
stronger fighters and some free items.

This is my first ever rom translation project. 
As of v1.02, my patch is nearly completely
distinct from Saiya Translations'.
In v1.01, I cleaned the script up and replaced
inaccurate translations. 
In v1.02, I looked at every single line and pointer 
doing my best to accomodate my script with the space 
available. I also did some really fun graphical 
changes, like with the title screen and some 
card icons, to name a few. These were largely done 
for the  sake of consistency with source material,
like changing Freeza's scouter to red.

I have a complete script prepared for any
interested hackers that can take advantage
of handakuten line space with ASM.

There are very few truncated portions of the script 
due to lack of ASM hacking knowledge, etc., but it's 
much better than v1.00 or v1.01.

I'm considering putting in the extra work for the
QoL ASM hacks that will give my script its ideal
form, but I don't think this is a bad way to play
the game.

Barring ASM hacks, etc., I consider this a polished
and complete translation. If you find any graphical
glitches, text that is truncated or doesn't make
sense, or anything like that, send a screenshot and
savestate to maruku115@gmail.com.

2. Patch History

-------------------------------------------------

-Version 1.02
 - Oh boy, I'm really proud of this release.
   As far as I know, maybe barring an inspired
   line or two, there are no traces of Saiya
   Translations' work in this patch.

 - There's a new font based on M-Tee's
   Elnark Short. Thanks, Romhacking.net and
   www.MTEEGFX.com

   All I added was shadows and a bunch of
   extra ligatures based on this font's style.

   I feel this font better uses the width of
   the 8 pixels so letters in words feel 
   less disjointed.
   
 - There's a new title screen that restores
   the "DO-RA-GO-N-BO-(-)-RU" on the DBs,
   changes Freeza's scouter color to the
   proper red, and a new title created by
   me based on Space Age font. It now looks
   cool, in my opninion, and has a closer
   meaning to the Japanese source with
   "TYRANT FREEZA".

 - Speaking of Freeza's scouter color, it's
   been changed everywhere else in the game,
   too, as far as I'm aware. I also opted to
   color-correct Bulma, ChiChi, Roshi, Senzu,
   Scouter, and a few others in their item icons. 

   Gohan's gi in the stat page was pink, so I 
   corrected it to its dark navy color.

   In a few of the cutscenes, I corrected some
   things, like Gohan's wristbands in the first
   plot being red instead of green.

 - Interestingly, there were some strange
   glitches with Piccolo's hands when damaged
   and Goku's elbow and knee when charging
   Kaioken-based moves. There may have been
   others, but this was another reason to
   become independent of Saiya Translations'
   former translation. The original doesn't
   have this issue and my v1.02 doesn't have
   it because it's based off the original
   now.

 - Changed bottom Dragon Balls from stars to
   roman numerals to be consistent with
   RedComet's works and because text references
   stars or numerals, not ATK or DEF.
   
 - The prior version was completely combed
   through with my original script to check
   for extra errors or places where things
   could make more sense. This took quite
   a lot of hours, but I'm mostly happy
   with the results.

 - I made some difficult choices with the tiles
   that allowed me to make something like 30
   ligatures (two characters per tile). These
   include il, li, ll, of course, but also many
   others that would normally go into a DTE
   routine. The reason I did it visually is because
   there's not much screen space, regardless of
   rom space I could free up.

 - Fixed a minor glitch with Piccolo sparring
   where his name would look like:
   Picc1lo Picc2lo
   They now both say Piccolo because expanding
   the original 4-tile name to 6 or 7 is beyond
   the current scope of this project.

 - Corrected "slow text" Senzu Bean. The [EB] tag
   usually used to signify that a choice selection 
   is coming up also happens to speed up the text 
   and is used in every item, but was removed probably 
   for rom space in the Saiya Translations hack.

-------------------------------------------------

-Version 1.01
 - Nearly completely rewrote the script.
   The prior version mostly translated the
   missing Japanese/Cavespeak sections, but
   this version has double-checked the original
   translation by Saiya Translations.

   In the prior version, I'd left their work
   largely alone, though I did change a few
   areas. In this version, however, I went
   line by line with their work compared to
   the original Japanese and changed quite a
   few paragraphs as a result.

   For example, the dialogue when landing on
   Namek was basically just fan guesses.
   Bulma isn't calling Krillin an idiot about
   bringing the radar, but rather she's upset
   that they stepped out into a planet with
   unknown atmosphere.

   Krillin and Gohan note that it reminds them
   of Earth instead of getting excited about
   the DBs. Bulma and Gohan have a conversation
   about strong ki in the area.

   Gupley on Kanassa wasn't sick, but looked
   like a bad guy.

   Speaking of Kanassa, I tried to remove
   the "reading between the lines" that the
   lack of space caused. It says this planet
   is in trouble, but the Japanese text
   references that the planet was sending out
   a distress signal. I had to call this SOS 
   for space, but that's better than not 
   mentioning it.

   These are just a few examples and that's by
   no means an exhaustive list of the changes.


 - Using the debug code and some playtesting, 
   I couldn't find any untranslated sections.

   I also tested Continue Z and it works as expected.


 - Title Screen Main Menu is now in English.


 - Battle text about countering fixed.
   It was saying, "Gupley1 countered Gupley"
   because a variable declaring the defending
   character's number was missing. It will now 
   correctly state something like:
   "Gupley2 countered Gupley1".
   You can see this quickly in the first few 
   battles, the Battle Royale mode,
   or when Piccolo is sparring.


 - Graphical glitches mostly fixed (Dodoria
   selecting a card will still cause a
   trailing "!" but most of the others
   should be gone).

   This includes healing on Freeza's ship, 
   which was somewhat hacky-looking but now
   looks like a proper selection menu.

   Even with moving pointers around, there was only
   room for 6 lines of 23-24 characters each, visually.
   Space-wise, you could insert F9 as a dictionary entry
   for Namek, etc., but it will still take 5 spaces and
   cause a glitch if it's the 24-25th character on a
   line.

   My script was still limited by these space constraints, 
   but it's better than it was.


 - Consistency checks (all dialogue should be
   using the Japanese parentheses now instead of 
   some using colons and no parentheses).

-------------------------------------------------

-Version 1.00
 90-100% of the text has been translated.
 Compared to the release this is based on,
 I'd say they were around 40% complete.
 I also made sure that most names were
 localized to fit the American dub and that
 they were accurate. (The final boss had
 "Doctor" as his name instead of "Freeza").

 Again, there are a lot of space contraints
 that cause this patch to just be a playable
 one. Having said that, I'd be happy to work
 with RedComet or anyone else as a translator
 who's also interested in the code!

-------------------------------------------------

3. Known Bugs

-------------------------------------------------

If a character is written in the last blank
space, or if a line is written past the
expected amount, there will be graphical
glitches that persist until the next screen
or set of text. (As of v1.02, most of these
are eliminated.)

This isn't the game's fault as much as it's
an issue based on the space constraint 
(As of v1.01, I've utilized pointers better and 
space is only an issue in the longest paragraphs). 

If I could use RedComet's ASM hack to
write on the dakuten/handakuten lines, I
could keep my original script intact.

Additionally, the Senzu Bean item's text
scrolls much slower than any other item's.
I'm not sure why this happens, but you can
press the (A) button to speed it up.
(As of v1.02 this is corrected).

There is some text that seems unreachable,
but I've still translated it.

For instance, there's a debug menu and I've 
translated it, but it's likely turned off
and inaccessible, though you can use most of
the features with a Game Genie code and a
second controller.

Also, there's an early section
similar to the anime filler where the mirror
ship can pull you in with a tractor beam.
I've tried saying No and reloading a lot of
times but couldn't reach this text/event.

If you can reach the debug menu or the ship
event, please contact me. Additionally, if
you somehow find some untranslated text or
gibberish, let me know, especially with a 
screenshot, so that I can track it down and
translate it.

These sections are likely dummied out and
inaccessible without lots of hex/asm hacking.
Therefore, I've dummied out their pointers
and used the extra text space. If you find
these in v1.01 or below, 
Saiya Translations' 0.70, 
or in the Japanese original, let me know.
However, there's no mention of them in any
of the Japanese resources I looked through.

4. Acknowledgements

-------------------------------------------------

I definitely have people to thank:

-Myself(Gyroballer): Most of the translation,
 localization, hex-editing, tile-editing, etc. 
 was done by me.

-Saiya Translations: The original translation team whose
 work allowed/inspired me to finish this translation.

 As of v1.02, there should be no relation to the
 Saiya Translations release. If you find any, let me
 know, and I'll take them out, if necessary.

 I will still credit them even now and even in the event 
 of a v2.00 or something like that utilizing ASM hacks, etc.

-Romhacking.net: Inspiration, documents, tools, 
 publishing this translation, Elnark Short font, etc. 

-M-Tee/www.mteegfx.com: Elnark Short font used heavily
 as base for my font. Only added shadows and ligatures.

-RedComet: Extreme inspiration from some of the best rom
 translations next to AGTP. I modeled this readme after
 them as well! I tried to use the ASM source code, but
 failed to make it work for DBZ2, but I'd be happy to
 provide script translation services if interested, or
 work more with the ASM code in the future, especially
 with guidance.

-My fiance: For supporting my selfish work habits
 while I was preparing this for the public! <3

Thanks to all the fans of DBZ because without you, I
made this patch for no one but me! Enjoy it!
