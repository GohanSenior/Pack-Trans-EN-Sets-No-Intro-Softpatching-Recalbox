NOTICE!!
-----------------
Do yourself a favor and pick "Puyopuyo" as your character. If you pick
"Human" not only does it look totally retarded, but the game still calls
them Puyopuyo :P

Patching Instructions
-----------------
Go to your favorite emulation site and download SNESTool. Drop it, the
patch, and the Japanese Puyo Puyo ROM into the same directory. Then
open SNESTool. If it's missing some extenders, you'll have to find 'em
on your own. Once you get SNESTool running, select (Use IPS) then the
puyopuyo.ips patch file, then the Japanese Puyo Puyo ROM. You should
now be patched.

-----------------
If you find a bug
-----------------
More than likely, it's untranslated text. Send a savestate or screenshot
(preferably the former, in NESticle format) to Gideon Zhi, and I'll try to
fix it.

How to Play
-----------------
Puyo Puyo is FUN!#!*(#!(*#!(*#!(*
It plays like Dr. Mario, but all of the pills are gelatinous blobs that,
while they require 4 to clear, can connect both sideways and vertically at
the same time. The directional pad move your puyopuyo, while the a and b
buttons will rotate your puyopuyo.

The Endless mode plays like Tetris -- as you clear puyo, you progress.
The Mission mode plays like Tetris 2 -- you have to complete certain
objectives before you can advance to the next mission. Here's a description
of the different objectives...

 GET X
 PUYOPUYO

This means that you have to clear X number of puyopuyo. If X is 23, it
will decrease every time you clear puyopuyo, and when it reaches zero, the
mission is complete.

  GETX AT
      ONCE

This objective requires you to clear X puyopuyo at the same time.

 X
  CHAINS

This objective is perhaps one of the toughest ones -- it requires you to
chain together puyopuyo eliminations. So you eliminate some, and some fall,
connecting with others and disappearing in the process. You just created
a "Chain". This objective requires you to complete X consecutive chains.

() COLOR
    CLEAR

This objective requires you to clear all of the puyopuyo of a specific color
which is shown by the puyopuyo to the left of the word "COLOR".

    XPUYO
 PUT PUYO

This objective requires you to place X puyopuyo (or X/2 columns of puyopuyo.)
So if X is twelve, you have to place 6 columns of puyopuyo.
