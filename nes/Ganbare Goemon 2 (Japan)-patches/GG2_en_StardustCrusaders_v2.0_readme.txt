About Goemon 2
======================================================
Project History:

Ah, this project was one of my first ever translation
projects and also one of those so-called "dream" projects
that I hoped to do at the time. I'm really fortunate that
SteveMartin offered to translate the script for me because
the reality was that I had no business hacking games at the
time. I was beginning to understand assembly at the time and
while I was able to complete the project, lots of compromises
were made to finish the thing. Compromises that I wouldn't make
now, but the whole thing was a learning experience.

I did one of my first notable ASM hacks on this project, which
was a DTE text compression routine that a fellow called kartes
aka g8z et al helped me with on M.I.J.E.T.'s super obscure
message board.

Anyhow, fast forward 10 years later and Tom et al have
released their translations for the entire SNES Goemon
series, which inspired me to finally redo my old Goemon 2
translation and give it the proper hacking it so rightfully
deserved.

The ROM has been expanded so that the script is no longer
truncated and Tom has basically done his own translation
of the game.

The text has been made single-spaced to fit more text on-screen.
It makes a huge difference in the shop with those tiny text boxes.

Tom has translated all the location signs in the game, I converted
them all to be horizontal and FlashPV designed all the graphics for
them. 

Anyhow, everything looks great and is now as it should truly be.

Patching Instructions

Apply the patch to the Japanese ROM:

Ganbare Goemon 2 (Japan).nes

We would be highly grateful, if you find some time to 
contact us with proposals or corrections. Information
on found bugs or corrections would be highly 
appreciated.

P.S.

Support the game industry by buying used games!

Even if the money doesn't go to the developers
directly, as the games become rare and harder
to find, the price goes up, and people become
more inclined to buy new releases "while they can!"
