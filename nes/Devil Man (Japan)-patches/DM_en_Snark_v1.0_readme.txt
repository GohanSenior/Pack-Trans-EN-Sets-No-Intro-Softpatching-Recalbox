1. TOKYO

Akira begins outside of the Makimura's brick home. Outside are a few thugs, that you will need to dodge. 
Inside the Ms. Makimura will greet you. Leave and go next door, and a man will tell you 
that your girlfriend Miki is waiting. Talk to Ms. Makimura, and Mr. Makimura who will ask if you saw
the TV program. Say no, and find out that the city has been attacked by demons! Go to Miki's room, 
and she will let you know that a strange fellow, Riyo Asuka wants to talk to you. Go outside and 
dodge the demons! Walk to the house with the red fence and meet Riyo, the odd fellow with blonde hair 
and a trenchcoat. Riyo's recounts the sad strange tale of his late father who headed a special secret
research unit for the investigation of demons. Akira's mother and father were members of this group, 
who trekked in search of demons in the Himalayas.Mr and Mrs Fudo die by the hands of demons, and Mr 
Asuka dies horrifically in his lab. Riyo swears revenge and asks you if you believe in your abilities, 
which you do of course. Riyo bids you to increase your anger and become Devilman, even at the expense of your human heart. Riyo opens the gates of hell, and now you must battle shapeshifting LADY DEMONS! Punch the ladies before they can transform into jumping green demons, and eventually a mask will appear. Snatch the mask and become Devilman! Hit them with your angry fireballs until they are no more. Your friend Riyo has mysteriously vanished.At this point you can waltz about town frightening the locals, or transform back into AKira, so they will no longer shriek in your presence. A townie lets you know that the secret unit went to the Makimuras. Check the house to find only sobbing Miki is left, apparently the Secret Unit came in search of demonic activity, and have taken the Makimuras away. Miki will heal you from this point, should you have any battle scars. 
 
Talk to the townspeople, who let you know that there is are secret ruins hidden underground, that girls should not walk outside unescorted, and that rogues can have good hearts and can be good allies. You can fight to build up ANGER points for Devilman to use as fireballs, and to increase life-bars. When you return to Miki, she will ask you to permit her to fight outside. "Miki can do  it! ", she says as she packs a mean wallop. 
Miki can defeat enemies in two slaps! When she enters Riyo's abandoned house, Dosoroku is waiting for her! 
Run or defeat him in a few slaps!  Have Miki run as fast a she can back to her room, and report the news to Akira! Miki will now wait at home, and Akira should now head back to Riyo's. Masa, another rogue is waiting there, and he's not talking. Punch him around a few times, and he will tell you a few things. He knows you have Devil power,that a secret lab is hidden in the woods and that you can increase Devilman's power by soaring into the sky!
 
Transform into Giant Devilman by transforming to Devilman, and transforming up again! Now you are as big as Godzilla and can stomp around Tokyo! Press up and you can fly! Avoid the Green and the Brown demons, walk to the right, into a grasy area until you see a sparkling shining ring. Enter the ring to face the first Boss Sirene! Sirene will chastize Amon, the demon Akira combined with. Apprently she loved Amon the bravest of all demons, and now swears to destroy him for his unforgivable deed. 

BOSS 

SIRENE is half bird, half demon, with a nasty flying claw. Defeat her as Devilman with full anger to do the most damage. When you defeat her, Aguwel, the messenger of demons, dispatches her ally! Loyal Kaimu, an ancient dinosaur-demon, runs to her rescue. Sirene is mortified as Kaimu rips off his head in sacrifice so that Sirene can combine with his body. 


SIRENE/KAIMU
With a Dinosaur body and a Sirene hood ornament, this deadly combination will charge at Devilman. Punch away 
until this loathsome duo is history! Take the second mask, level up, you've earned it! Transform into Devilman into Akira, and enter the forest. Dodge the carnivorous plants, and enter the black hole between 
the trees for the secret entrance to the next level. 


2. Underground Lava Caves 
Fall down and go to the right and talk to a human that has fled into the caves to escape the demons. The monk that you will speak to below will recognize that you are no ordinary human if you are Devilman, and will also fill up your life-bar. If you are Akira, he lets you know that a man of strength can tear down walls....hmmmm. 
If the music changes into the emergency theme, then you will notice that a demon has trappped a human in its claws! This stage is important because it will affect your rank!

Rescue the human? If you select yes the human will run for it and the demon will run after you! Defeat it in two hits, and your rank will go up!

If you select no the human will explode in the devil's claws, and the demon will run away taunting you!

****Notes on Devilman Rank:******

Rank is displayed when you select the password function. The ranks are in increments of one; 16 possible statuses. Rank can increase by defeating bosses or by saving humans. There are four human faces on the top right hand screen, which are indicators of saved humans.  Keep them from turning into skulls by saving them!  If status drops below the sixteenth, the game will be over.  Your rank will increase if you defeat bosses and rescue captured humans.  Your rank will decrease if you decline to rescue the captured humans, and the last remaining human face is a skull.  

In the caves that appear to be empty, use the talk function to listen to some spooky scary voices such as 
"I am Aguwel Messenger of Hell... Closer devilman" or "Devilman....whoooo....we are your enemies". In one of the caves there is a purple demon! Bash it and it will taunt you..."You're losing your human heart Devilman!"
Now its time to do some serious spelunking, from the monk go back up and to the left to the rocky ledges. 
Avoid falling in hot lava, falling stalactites, shrouded wall-walkers, burrowing shell-monsters, and deadly carnivorous pears throughout this place! Go right to the false walls, go up and right, then fall down, 
go left over lava pits, and fall again. Go to the left and over the lava, destroy another rock wall to find the second sparkling ring!

Boss:

AGUWEL

This creepy green tentacled beast is the Messenger of Hell, and he tells Devilman to rot in it! Squiggly Aguwel can split in two and throw rocks at you, so fire away with angry firepower! Defeat half of him, and replenish your life, and then finish him off for the second mask! Go through the door outside and see what's left of Tokyo!

"Whatcha gonna do, torture me?" he says. He's hiding something. Eventually he will dish some info about the Makimuras and a key. Leave, go down, right, and break another wall, and enter the cell. This demonic humanoid  has some pretty scary teeth, and he tells you that he likes to eat humans and wear their skin!

ask him to save Miki. As Masa you will be transported to Miki's pink bedroom, and she will scream in surprise.

These mini demons are Geruma's newly hatched hell-spawn! After beating enough of them, Akira returns and
vows that he will keep Miki safe from demons. Now its time to beat the demons on their own turf! 

6. Ice World of Demons:

only two friendly green-demons here to fill your life bar, one to the bottom left door and one to the top left door. Go right up, left up, left up, to the topmost left ledge. (YOu can go through the door and fill up, avoiding the swarming bat-demons. Go right and up through the door. Go right, and confront an ugly brown demon!

Move quickly to the spot before the second post, dodge his fireballs, and time your jump to smash his middle face! Avoid his clutching grasp and knock him until he is no more!


*****ENDING**** Four alternative endings.

Devilman game ending info:  

The endings are as follows and dependent on events that occur during/after the Tokyo Ruins stage:

1. If you rescue Mr. and Mrs. Makimura, Ms. Izumi, and Miki, you have the option of defeating Satan after Xenon. If you defeat him the ending will be the best ending with credits and pcitures of all the nice people that you saved. 

2. If you rescue Mr. and Mrs. Makimura, Ms. Izumi, and Miki, you have the option of defeating Satan after Xenon. If you do not defeat him the ending will be pretty gruesome. 

3. If you rescue Mr and Mrs Makimura, Ms. Izumi and but not Miki, the ending will be different after defeating Xenon, you get to see a sad message and the little brown devil mask.

4. If you do not rescue Mr and Mrs Makimura (the options of rescuing Miki and Ms Izumi will not happen) and the ending will be different after defeating Xenon you get to see another message and the brown devil mask.
