Silva Saga
======================================================
Background: This was one of my first works which was 
constantly delayed and postponed due to various (mostly
technical) reasons. It started more than a year ago
and finally the ship has come to the shore. 

The game itself is a DQ clone from the first sight but
don't let it fool you. This a pretty solid work with
kick-ass graphics (for NES, of course), rather deep
story (for NES again) and even day/night cycle.

This game is a spiritual successor of Minelvaton Saga.
The story starts about 100 years later when a young
prince named Kyral (by default) rushes for another
"kill-a-bad-guy" quest which throws him and his
ever-changing team into long-lasting struggle between
light and dark gods. The only drawback I found was that
the game is just fantastically easy so it won't be
a challenge for veterans. 

Use a patching IPS utility of your choice to apply the
patch. 

I would be highly grateful, if you find some time to 
contact me with proposals or corrections. Information
on found bugs or corrections would be highly 
appreciated.     

Enjoy the playing and do buy the game, if you like it!
(Although I know it's extremely rare :))

======================================================
IMPORTANT NOTE BEFORE YOU START PLAYING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
======================================================
The game was dumped very badly so DELETE ALL THE SAVE
FILES ON THE TITLE SCREEN, THEN CHOOSE AN EMPTY ONE!
If you don't do that, you'll stuck in the middle of
nowhere!!!!!!!!
======================================================
CHANGES IN VER.1.01
Some minor typos were corrected (thanks to Jame Coban
for those), small bug in the Temple of Manus corrected
and it also has a brand new better-looking 
font (credits to klowner).
======================================================= 

Credits go to:
ASchultz - my constant helping hand in editing and 
proofreading activities.
Thanks man, you're the best ;)

ded302 - for ROM expansion work - without him this
project would be a rough image of the final vatint -
I owe you one, man ;)

Djinn - for his patience and frequent consultings.
Due to his help I was able to learn debugging and
hacking (at least for my level). He's also 
responsible for some boxes in the game.

fuzzball, ryusui, BRPXQZME - for their professional
help with Japanese in damn-hard cases.

Jame Coban - for his comments on found typos and 
errors. 

klowner - for a new better font. 

All those who contributed into this process.
