AlanMidas - everything
There... me... that's about it for the most part
If you find any bugs in this(overlapping tex/typos/anything), please let me know. It might take a few years, but I'll try to get it fixed and put a new patch out there =)!


New This update:
Fixed like 2 or 3 typos, nothing too dramatic.

Old Updates:
BS.VQ(Feb,2007)
Fixed my bad hacking and typos from the last release.

Special thanks:
Thanks to my brother Toma for helping me with the origional font I used, and getting me into emulation.
And thanks to everybody who got after me for not doing stuff for awhile so I could get it done, and for sending me typos/etc after the last version(too many people to list =p).
And thanks to those people who gave nice encouraging insentive stuff too(like Spinner 8 for offerring to start hurting people if they didn't respond to my translation request... which wasn't responded too anyway... but it got done, so hey all's happy =p)

ummm... that's about all I can think to put in here... so that's all folks!

Older updates(1998-2000):
