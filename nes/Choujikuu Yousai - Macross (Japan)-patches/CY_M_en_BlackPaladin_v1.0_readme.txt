-BlackPaladin's Super Dimensional Fortress Macross NES Patch-
-------------------------------------------------------------

*Chou-Jikuu Yousai Macross*

I made another patch out of boredom while waiting for other translation work to be checked on.  This time, I did one for the NES/Famicom game, "Chou-Jikuu Yousai Macross" (Super Dimensional Fortress Macross).  This was one of three anime series that made up the show, "Robotech" in the 1980's.

Patching Instructions:

This patch comes in two flavors:

Super-Dimensional Fortress Macross (English).ips (English Patch in IPS Format)
Super-Dimensional Fortress Macross (English).bps (English Patch in BPS Format)

I suggest using Lunar IPS for patch.  Use either patch, according to your personal preference.

Be sure to use on a NES ROM (24,592 bytes) with a header and with a CRC Checksum of A3CA24D2.  Where to find said ROM is up to you.  I cannot tell you where to look for it.

What changes have been done:

Title Screen translated, of course
Font Changed to a more futuristic font
