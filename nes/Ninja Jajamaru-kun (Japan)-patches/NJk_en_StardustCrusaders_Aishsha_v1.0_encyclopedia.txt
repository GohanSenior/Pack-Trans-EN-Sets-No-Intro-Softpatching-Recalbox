Bonehead - that's simply a skeleton, jumping around the level.

Kakutan - this one looks like Nurikabe from Gegege series - a big moving monster wall.

Karakassa (Karakasa) - Kasa Obake, are a type of Tsukumogami, a form of Japanese Spirit that originate from objects reaching their 100th year of existence, thus becoming animate. Karakasa in particular are Spirits of Parasols (umbrellas) that reach the century milestone. They are typically portrayed with one eye, a long tongue protruding from an open mouth, and a single foot, generally wearing a geta.

Kurobee - this one is unknown to me but that's just a penguin-like enemy. 

Oyuki - this one is most probably a pun. Oyuki is most likely the "Yuki-onna" or Snow Woman - a quite famous character from
Japanese folklore.

Pinbou - one-eyed monk which looks more like an ogre.
