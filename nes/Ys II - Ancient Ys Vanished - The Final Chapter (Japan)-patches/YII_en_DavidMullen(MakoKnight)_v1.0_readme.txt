Notes
=====

After finishing Ys 1, I was still looking for something else to do. I
thought it'd be nice to do the sequel, since the first two games'
storylines tie very closely together. I knew of another group doing it,
at http://members.xoom.com/ys_project/ but they hadn't updated in two
years. I read about their problem, and thought I could help out. But
a day or so after emailing them, it bounced back. So I just decided to
take it on myself. I was fortunate that the text was encoded in the
same style as Ys 1. It did take a little longer to finish than I
expected, but that was no problem.

I don't plan on doing any more Ys games, since the third part is
already available on the SNES and Genesis consoles (I recommend the
Genesis one, myself). And parts four and five are being taken care of.
If you ever get the chance, be sure to play the Turbo Duo version of
Ys Book I-II. Although it's quite old, it's still an excellent classic.

Instructions
============

The file "ys2e.ips" must be patched to the original ROM image to play
this translation. Any IPS patching utility should work. Two commonly
used utilities are IPS.exe and Snestool. You can find these two
programs at most emulation websites.

*** Always keep a backup of the original ROM image. ***

To use IPS.exe, run this at a command prompt:

IPS <ROM NAME> <IPS NAME>

Snestool has a graphic interface that makes it easier. After starting
it, select "Use IPS", then select the IPS file, then the ROM image
that it should be used on.

This game has been tested with the NESten and Nesticle emulators. If
the game shows jerkiness or flashing, try tweaking the timing
settings.
