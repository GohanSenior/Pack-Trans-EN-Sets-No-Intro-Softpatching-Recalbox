***WARNING***:  I have yet to test this on other emulators but the game Rainbow Silkroad is 
known to crash sometimes on Nesticles when falling down certain pitfalls or using certain 
stairs.  To rememdy the situation go to the option NES Timing and change the HBlanks from the 
default 115 to a lower value.  I have tested it at 80 and the game works fine.  

If someone would like to enlighten me on why it does this it would be appreciated.  I doubt 
though that it has anything to do with the actual romhacking performed on the rom.
