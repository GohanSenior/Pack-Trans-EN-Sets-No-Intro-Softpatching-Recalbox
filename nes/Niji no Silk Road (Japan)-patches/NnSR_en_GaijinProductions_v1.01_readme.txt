About the Game
--------------
You have just learned that you are a prince from a small kingdom off of the 
Silkroad called Littleland.  When you were young evil forces conspired against
your family resulting in your parents' demise.  Fortunately, a loyal family 
retainer, Radley, was able to whisk you away to safety and left you in the care 
of the old family wet nurse.  Now you must find the pieces of the Rainbow Mirror
scattered across the Silkroad in order to return home.  Armed with this item you
will be able to reveal the truth and reclaim your kingdom.

The game has a strong commerce element.  You must trade goods in the cities along 
the Silkroad.  You have access to several basic goods/commodities in the beginning, 
but as you fight you earn License Points (LP) which allow you to earn a new License 
for the area you are in.  A License permits you to trade a good you previously 
never had access to before.  You do not gain levels either.  Instead as you make 
money you buy new arms which increases your strength and total HP.


About the Project
-----------------
This was the first romhacking project I ever attempted.  At the beginning of summer of 
1998 I left for home and decided to learn try my hand at NES romhacking. All I had were
tools and utilities gathered from various sites and all the romhacking docs I could find.
I tried for a few days then gave up finding it tedious and having to start my summer job.  
I had made very, very little progress.  Two weeks before having to return to college my 
summer job ended.  I decided to try my hand at Silkroad again.  A little into it I decided 
to start over and in those two weeks I had successfully translated 15% of the game.  
However I had done this without a script dump and a disgustingly huge amount of "two 
letters in one tile" combinations.  Well after that I had a few people playtest this alpha 
and MadHacker did some great enhancements but after all this I left the project on the shelf.

Then winter break hit (December 19th I think).  The week before it began I decided to learn 
ver basic script dumping and using Jair's utility Script Extractor (yeah, I'm one of 
the few who doesn't use Thingy) I had dumped the entire script as well as several lists.  
I went home and booted up the old 486 and started all over again.  A couple of days 
before winter break ended (January 19th) I had completed all the translating and romhacking.

I returned and look for playtesters.  I found a few willing to do so and sent them the beta. 
As time passed they sent me bugs and fixed those up.  I also had some fantastic assistance from Madhacker.  He did wonders with expanding certain areas I couldn't.  Now, into the 
beginning of February, Wampus reported in being the first and so far only (besides myself) 
person to finish the game.  Well this project has waited long enough so here it is, Rainbow Silkroad released...

I've worked long enough on this one and there are only a few buggy things left.  The enemies 
Cpede and Mpede have yet to be changed.  It's easy enough to do it but I'm lazy.  Also the
store sign bother me but that's how they were don in the Japanese version.  If I had 50 or so 
extra tiles free i could replace the letters with graphic signs but i don't.  Finally the
buy/sell options are condensed.  I've done everything I can but can't expand it unless I
sacrafice something else so that stays.  Well that's it.  If there's text error tell me, if 
you want to complain I don't want to here it.
