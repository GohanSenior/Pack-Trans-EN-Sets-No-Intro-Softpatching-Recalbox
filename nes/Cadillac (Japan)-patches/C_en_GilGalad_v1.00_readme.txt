Game Details
---------------
Cadillac is a playing card puzzle game featuring several
women that try to take every last bit of money from you.
The object of the game is to clear all of the cards from 
the board at the end of the deck in order to win the level.
You can continue to play even if you do not wish to win the
level. In this case, you will earn and lose money on the same
level.

In order to play the game, you need to get poker hand combinations
as the cards fall from the top. Such combinations include; flushes,
straights, 3 of a kind, 4 of a kind. In order to get four to five card
combinations, they need to be gotten horizontally and not vertically.

This game can be somewhat challenging for a simple puzzle game.
