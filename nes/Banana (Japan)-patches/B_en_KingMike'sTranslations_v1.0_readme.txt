Banana translation by KingMike

Introduction
------------
Banana is a puzzle game for the Famicom, created by Victor/JVC.
The idea is you're this mole, and you crawl around in the dirt.
I think you just need to lead his girlfriend (I don't know) Keyko
to the door to finish the level.

But he can go only down. If you want to go back up, you need a ladder.
Also, once you dig under a boulder, it will fall after you pass it.
That may block your path later.
Try to complete the level in fewer moves for a better score.

I didn't really play this one a whole lot. I just tried it out,
noticed the only Japanese text in the game is a single graphic.
So I quickly whipped out a translation patch.

Patching
--------
I've seen a few different ROM dumps of this game going around.
The properly dumped ROM is 48KB. Apply the "banana48K" IPS to that ROM.
I've also seen a 64KB ROM. That one's an overdump, and what I used to create the original version of the patch "banana-e.ips"
Last I checked, the GoodNES "good" ROM was 40KB. THAT ONE IS A BAD DUMP!
Sorry, it's missing data. I can't help you with that one. It's trash. Just delete it and find a good one.
