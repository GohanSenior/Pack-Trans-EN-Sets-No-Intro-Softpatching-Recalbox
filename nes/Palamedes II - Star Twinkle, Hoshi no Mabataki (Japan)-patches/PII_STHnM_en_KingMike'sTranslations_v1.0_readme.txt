How to play:

Palamedes II is a puzzle game where you throw dice from a stack at the bottom of the screen,
towards a lone die at the top. You must throw a die that is the same number or sequential
(one higher or lower).
Each time you match the die, it will be added to your "hand" (similar to a poker hand)
at the top of the screen.
When you have made a matching hand, you can use it to clear one or more lines from the stack,
depending on the combination.
The game contains two major game "modes" with variations. In one more, you need to survive,
while in the other you must compete against another player or the CPU to clear your stack first.

Control Pad:
 Left/Right: Move player
 Up: Raise stack
 Down: When you have a matching hand, press Down to use it.
 Select: None
 Start: Pause
 B Button: Press to rotate the column underneath the player (in Mode 1)
 A Button: Press to throw the die under the player at the block.

Mode 1 : Survival
 Solo : Endless single-player game
 Match : Two-player competition to defeat the other player
 Quest : Single player vs. a series of computer opponents. Choose three difficulties.
Mode 2 : Clear all tiles. In this mode you cannot rotate the stack.
When both players are unable to make a valid move, the game will pause the match to
generate a new target die.
 Match : For two players
 Quest : Compete against a series of computer opponents.

Winning combinations:

DUST           1 Line       Any four?
SEVEN TIMES    1 Line       A total of seven on dice?
DOUBLE         2 Lines      Two pairs of matching dice
THREE STRAIGHT 2 Lines      Three consecutive numbers
THREE FLUSH    2 Lines      Three of a kind
FOUR STRAIGHT  3 Lines      Four consecutive (descending?)
FOUR FLUSH     3 Lines      Four of a kind
ROYAL FLUSH    4 Lines      Four consecutive (ascending?)

No distributing the patch with ROM, either pre-patched, or in one zip.
That's wrong.
