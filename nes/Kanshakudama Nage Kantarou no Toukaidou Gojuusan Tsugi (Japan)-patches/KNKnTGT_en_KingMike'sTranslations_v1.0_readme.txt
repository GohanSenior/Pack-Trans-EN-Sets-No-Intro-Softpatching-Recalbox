***********
INTROUCTION
***********
Kantaro is trying to complete a journey across the Toukaido, the ancient
road between Kyoto and Edo. He wants to get to the Sumida River.
Will his love Momoko be waiting him?
'kay, so Kantaro's got an endless bag of bombs, and he's ready to blow up
anyone who stands in his way. He'll also blow up that doesn't stand in his
way, 'cause there might be treasure behind it.
A basic platformer with loads of hidden items to find to make it strangely
addictive.
Originally released on July 3, 1986 by Sunsoft, this game resurfaced in
Sunsoft's "Sunsoft Memorial" rerelease series for the PS1.
Play alone, or challenge a friend for the high score in the 2 Player
Mode (alternating play)!

WHAT'S DONE
***********
Everything should work. I haven't really tested it out to the end, 'cause I kinda suck at
hardcore platform games, like many early NES games were.

PATCHING INSTRUCTIONS
*********************
All you need to do is download any patch application program.
Use something like Lunar IPS. Open it, then choose the patch, and the unhacked Japanese ROM. Then apply.
If you've already run Lunar IPS once, all you need to do is double-click the patch, then choose the ROM
from the prompt.

APPLY ONLY ONE OF THE TWO PATCHES!
kanta1cz.ips applies a hacked up Cezanne font to the game, which I think looks pretty nice.
kanta1.ips   applies a normal old school NES font to the game, which is more readable.

****************
EMULATION ISSUES
****************
This game uses Mapper 184, not the most common one.
So, get an NES emulator with high compatibility, like FCEUltra.

*****************
PLAY INSTRUCTIONS
*****************
Control Pad - move Kantaro
Select - Choose 1P GAME or 2P GAME on the title.
Start - Pause game (only Player 1 can pause. The FC didn't have 2P Start, remember?)
B Button - Throw bomb. You throw father when you're running faster.
 Stop moving, and press Down + B to drop a bomb on the ground.
A Button - Jump.

I'm not really sure what the powerups do. I think you can pay off some of the
characters in the levels with them.
Like I know this one guy in like the fourth level slows you down. But if you give him
a bag thingey, he'll go away.
If you can find an onigiri (rice ball), you'll start rolling invincibly along the ground.
The object of the game is to make it to the right side of the stage.
And, um, don't get hit. Getting hit is bad, because you instantly die.
If you lose all your lives, get to go back to the title screen.

At the top of the screen is which player is playing (first or second), number of lives, and
a map of how far along in the Toukaido you are.
Then you have your score, and the distance you must travel (in Li, a measurement system used in olden days
of Japan) to complete the stage, and how many of the treasures you have.
