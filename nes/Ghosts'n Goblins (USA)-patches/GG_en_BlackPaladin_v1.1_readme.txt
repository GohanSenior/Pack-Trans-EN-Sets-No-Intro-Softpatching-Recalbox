-BlackPaladin's Demon World Village Patch-
------------------------------------------

************
*Makai-Mura*
************

I was waiting for some translation work on some other projects, so I came up with this patch out of boredom.  This translates the Japanese game Makai-Mura (Demon World Village).  For those in the English-speaking regions, this game was released as "Ghosts n' Goblins".

Patching Instructions:

This translation patch come in four flavors:

Demon World Village (English).ips
--This patch requires a clean and unaltered Makai-Mura ROM (IPS format)
Demon World Village (English).bps
--This patch requires a clean and unaltered Makai-Mura ROM (BPS format)
Demon World Village B (English).ips
--This patch requires a clean and unaltered Ghosts n' Goblins ROM (IPS format)
Demon World Village B (English).bps
--This patch requires a clean and unaltered Ghosts n' Goblins ROM (BPS format)

I recommend using Lunar IPS for applying the IPS patches.  Flips can be used to apply the IPS or BPS patches.

For the patches...
Demon World Village (English v1.1).ips
Demon World Village (English v1.1).bps

Use the ROM with the following hashes. (Don't use both.)

File SHA-1: 22C99336AB8B9D3C1FA57E981766BC38CDB8FD6E
File CRC32: 8C3FE6FB
ROM SHA-1: F8B38262C2AC00CF4E3E653F2987BDADC86F839E

For the patches...
Demon World Village B (English v1.1).ips
Demon World Village B (English v1.1).bps

Use the ROM with the following hashes. (Don't use both.)

ROM SHA-1: CA03C76B65F0FE5B1D05149D7E9A97B4D5F44A27
