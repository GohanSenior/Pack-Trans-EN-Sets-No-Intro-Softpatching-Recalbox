SD Hero Soukessen - Taose! Aku no Gundan
English translation patch
=====================================================


This is the second game in the Compati Series, which stars heroes from various franchises: Ultraman,
Gundam and Kamen Rider, among others. It was developed by Banpresto in 1990.


------------------------------
How to apply the patch:
------------------------------
1 - Download the ROM "SD Hero Soukessen - Taose! Aku no Gundan (J).nes".
2 - Download a program to patch the IPS onto the ROM, like Lunar IPS (http://fusoya.eludevisibility.org/lips/).
3 - Copy the ROM and the IPS file named "SD Hero Soukessen - Patch ENG.ips" to the same folder, and use the
option "Apply IPS Patch" in Lunar IPS, to apply the patch.

OR

1 - If you are using an emulator that accepts on-the-fly IPS patching (like Nestopia), you can just rename the
ROM and the IPS file to the same name, leaving out the extension.
Example: The rom is named "SD Hero Soukessen - Taose! Aku no Gundan (J).nes"
         Just rename the IPS to "SD Hero Soukessen - Taose! Aku no Gundan (J).ips"

(Newer versions of Nestopia can apply IPS patches without the need to have the same name. Just open the ROM,
then the IPS file).


------------------------------
Distribution
------------------------------
Don't ask me for the prepatched ROM.

I don't care if you upload your patched ROM for others. If you do this, please attach this readme file
in the same .zip as the ROM.


-------------------------------
Story
-------------------------------
It's kinda hard to find information about this game anywhere, so here's the plot:

One day, Emmy was taking care of her gashapon machine (those claw prize machines), when she and her machine
were abducted by the evil Dark Brain. However, the gashapons of the legendary heroes Ultraman, Gundam, Shaider
and Kamen Rider, were freed from the machine. Now the heroes have to rescue Emmy from Dark Brain.

And yeah, this is the same Emmy from the Great Battle and Super Robot Wars OG series.


-------------------------------
Misc
-------------------------------
You can jump on the flying enemies. For some reason, they are much tougher than ground enemies.

The invincibility state in this game is a hindrance.

Saikoro Gundam.

There's a cheat code to switch characters on-the-fly. You can find it on GameFAQs, or as an IPS patch on
Romhacking.net. This code would later become a gameplay mechanic in the Great Battle series.
