  Gah, this patch didn't include some other fixes, so you were getting
  a very hard game due to protection. It's fixed now.

December 24, 2006
  Didn't think I'd be updating THIS again, did ya?

  Okay, so there was this really freakin' obscure bug that TheFreak found.
  Basically one of the pointers was wrong. If time ran out when you fought
  a certain boss... well, Penko would go on about a Pig Battleship before
  dumping your sorry butt. This has been fixed. Two bytes, woohoo.

  Konamicrack strikes again.

  The game had protection that made the game much harder if anyone modified
  the game in any way. This protection wasn't in the original bad dump that
  kalevan used for his translation...

  Vorname Nachname, a German person [... who happens to know more 6502 ASM
  than me] emailed me telling me about that thing; and he later sent a fix
  for the protection, which is now in the patch.

  However... well, there are two patches in this archive. One [yume100.IPS]
  is the fixed version of the patch; it has no protection whatsoever.
  The other patch [yume100a.IPS] is MUCH harder, since it has protection
  [this is the older patch]. So if you want a challenge, use that patch.

May 30, 2003
  Well, I'll be damned.

  I'm done. [And this is the second time I've said that!]

  My original intention was to release this patch on June 28, 2003... which
  is my birthday. But, since I was nervous and couldn't really do anything
  school-related, I set upon finishing up the translation today. Why?
  I dunno. I just felt like it.

  Many thanks go to sl1me, who provided me with almost all of the graphics
  that were changed for this translation. I had to adapt a few, thanks to
  the weed that Konami's programmers smoked here. AGAIN. Goddamn their "03"
  hex opcode... damn it to hell... *shakes paw*

  This release is dedicated to FEFEA's own video game destroyer, adaml. It's
  his birthday! A rare coincidence. Everyone say happy berfday when you see him.
  K? K.

What's left:
-----------------
  There -MAY- be some messages that may show up and not be translated. The reason
  is that there was a lot of the script that didn't get used. I did get it
  translated, but I didn't insert it. I don't think it was used, it makes
  reference to some sort of race that isn't in the game...


Game Notes:
-----------------
  The pad moves Penta, A makes him jump, B makes him attack. In the plane
  stages, both buttons make his plane shoot.

  You have two ways of losing the game: Being too fat or running out of time.
  When you play, grab the Fat-B-Gone bottles to lose weight. Once your weight
  is low enough so that the heart in the status bar gets unbroken, you're in the
  clear. But falling into the water or even eating ONE food item will send it all
  to hell.

  Also, if you run out of time, Penko will complain and make you play the stage
  again. So be sure to grab ALL THE CLOCKS you can! I am aware that the game tells
  you that you have a lot of time, but doesn't really give you that much. This is
  a game bug, the script was like that in the Japanese release.

  And stay away from the food. I can't stress this enough. The game doesn't seem
  too difficult, but it IS. It's almost impossible to beat the game without using
  savestates or cheats. So good luck.

  Also, patch the rom that Goodnes 1.01 and higher recognizes as the GOOD rom!
  I haven't tested it with ANY OTHER variants, be them [p], [h], [b], or whatever.
  
  And most importantly, you CAN NOT upload a pre-patched rom to your website.
