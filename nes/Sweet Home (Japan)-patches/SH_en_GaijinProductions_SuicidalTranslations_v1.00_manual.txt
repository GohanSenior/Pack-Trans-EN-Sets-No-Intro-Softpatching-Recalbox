Sweet Home Manual
-----------------
by Musashi of Gaijin Productions

This is a quick and dirty manual to teach you the essentials
of Sweet Home's gameplay.

A  ---  Accept/Action
B  ---  Cancel

Start --- Pause
Select -- Nothing

Pressing A will bring up the Command Menu
Pressing B will bring up a Status List

Items
-----
Each person has 4 item slots.  

Slot 1:
The topmost slot is for that character's main item.  
This cannot be switched or traded with common items. 
Each character starts with a main item.

Slot 2 & 3:
These two slots in the middle are used to carry common 
items you find in the mansion.

Slot 4:
The bottom slot is reserved for a weapon.  This is the
only slot weapons can be placed in and any weapon in this
slot is considered automatically "equipped".

To pick up an item: 
Face the item, then select "Item" from the Command Menu. 
Then select a slot and select "Move."  If the item can be
picked up it will be "taken" by your character, or if the
slot you select has an item in it, the possessed item will 
be "switched" with you one you're trying to pick up.

Party & Team
------------
The "Party" command allows you to swtich between any five of 
your characters.  However, certain status ailments such as severe 
poison (XPnX) will immobilize a character, not allowing you to
switch to him or her.

The "team" command allows a person to team up with other 
members of your party.  A team can be comprised of either 2 or 3 
people.  If you are not facing another team member and are already
in a team, that lead character will split from his/her team.

Pray
----
You have a certain amount of Pray points.  Selecting the 
"Pray" command will bring up a vacillating gauge.  The higher
you can stop the bar the more points you will use and the 
more effective you're prayer will be.  "Pray" can be used in
battle to inflict damage and in special exploration scenes.
