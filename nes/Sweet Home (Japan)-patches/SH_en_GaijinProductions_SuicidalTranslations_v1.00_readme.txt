About the Game
--------------
Sweet Home is a Famicom game released by Capcom in 1989.  The game is an 
RPG that incorporates "survival horror" elements.  The game stars five 
members of an investigation team, equipped with... well, your standard 
investigation equipment (Cigarette Lighter, Medicine Box, Camera, Vacuum, 
and a Key).  The team enters the abandoned Mamiya Mansion to investigate 
and document the painter Mamiya Ichirou's famous frescoes.  However, as 
soon as they enter they find themselves trapped within the manor and 
terrorized at every turn.  You must guide the five characters through 
various puzzles and battles to escape the mansion.

The original Japanese names romanized into English are as follows:
	Kazuo
	Akiko
	Taguchi
	Asuka
	Emi
However the game only allows a maximum of six letters for each name.  
"Taguchi" obviously exceeds the length limitation by one.  In addition, 
the game only allows the default names to be five letters long.  "Taguchi" 
has been replaced with the name "Taro".  Also to clarify Kazuo and Taguchi
are male while the other three are female.  So be mindful if you choose
to rename them.

This game fits in well with the rest of the Resident Evil series.  While 
the game is not an official prequel, it is often cited as the inspiration
for the Resident Evil/Biohazard series that began on the PSX.  Sweet Home
can safely be classified as a puzzle-RPG with "Survival Horror" elements.
For a Famicom game it is extraordinarily graphic at times.



About the Project
-----------------
I began this project back in 1999 (I'm fairly sure).  A script was dumped 
and light translation and romhacking work was done by myself.  By May 23rd 
of 1999 I received exciting news from The MadHacker.  He had done what I had 
failed to do, he had figured out the naming screen.  Apparently, two 
characters are hard coded on the said screen.  Then Demi/strength contacted 
me with a title screen design for Sweet Home.  Preliminary attempts at 
inserting the screen were difficult (mostly, as I discovered, because I 
can't cut and paste my way out of a cardboard box) and as a result that 
aspect was left for last.  Then, InVerse of Suicidal Translations offered 
the assistance of Ataru, a translator at ST who just finished the Monster 
Maker script.  Gladly accepting the offer, the script was returned 
completely translated a short while later.  Things were moving positively 
and rapidly. Then I gave it up...  I was busy with other things so the 
project just sat there until May of 2000.  On the twenty-third of May I 
finally figured out the pointers for the monsters (not really pointers) 
after many, many ours of searching.  It's not as difficult to figure if 
you're looking for the right thing (it was not your traditional pointer 
setup).  Then began the manual romhacking of text, which concluded quickly 
on June 1st.  All romhacking done by hand.  Yup, handmade, no insertors.  I 
can't program.  It's slow as hell but that's how I do things, but this 
should serve as an example that you don't have to be tech head to do this.

The only thing that bugs me is that the game displays a six letter name 
every time one is mentioned in the text.  So you will see extra spaces after 
a name if your characters have names of five letters or less.  This cannot 
be resolved at this time and I doubt it will be in the future.
