Gameplay:
---------
On the map, enter each stage by pressing Up. The stage selection is random.
In every stage, you need to collect 6 keys before entering the Musical Theater.
To get the keys, defeat the enemies that appear on items like coffins & jars. Jumping next to those will make them appear.
Take note of the Letters & Numbers that appear when you defeat the enemies. You will need those in the Musical Theater.

In Cow Head Stage, collect the J-e-N-n-Y letters by jumping at the beginning on the upper floor (around two screens),
then kick the fire pot to get the dagger. Press Select to use. It is strong against Cowheads, but it has limited use.
After clearing all the Cowheads, run at the bottom floor towards the right wall.

Whomanchun is just a weird fortune-teller with a Chinese verbal tic. Nothing special.
