About the Game
--------------
In 2089, the manmade space probe, Prometheus, encountered the space armada of the Baal Empire.
At first peace existed and human technology leaped forward with the help of the Baal.  However
some wary individuals joined a group called the "Resistance" which worked to prepare mankind
against a possible betrayal by the Baal.  They worked with the military and began the Tetrastar
fighter project.  However a period of peace saw to the termination of the project.  Then in 
2091 the betrayal came and the Baal turned from helping Earth to trying to destroying it.  
Immediately you, the test pilot of the Tetrastar project, must return as you stand as man's 
only chance at survival... 

About the Project
-----------------
Well, one day (maybe a couple of months ago) I was reading through posts on ZD's romhacking
board.  I saw an unanswered post by |tsr about a translation request for a Famicom shooter
called Tetrastar.  Knowing he was well-versed in all things Famicom I tried the game out, 
looked at the text, and decided I'd do it.  I contacted tsr| wondering if he wanted to do the
translation.  Fortunately he was and graciously translated the script I sent.  But he noticed
that this was only half of the script.  I went back into the rom and low and behold I had
missed the second half of the script located after a large banks of FF's.  Eventually I the
entire script was translated by him and I got to hacking it back in.  Well here's the finished 
project enjoy.

Now one more point.  I don't take requests at all.  In fact if you ask me directly I'll 
be more inclined to avoid it than even look at it.  So no requests.  The only ones I consider
are ones posted in a general forum that have some intelligence behind them.  I don't translate
games because they fall into this or that adored theme (such as Dragon Ballz or something 
along those lines).  Gameplay and story are the elements I'm looking for.  So any direct 
requests to me will be ignored.

Thanks
