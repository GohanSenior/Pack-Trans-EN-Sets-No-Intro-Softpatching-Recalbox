                               Translation

------------------------------- DEDICATION -------------------------------
 
This translation is dedicated to Reijin cuz he asked first and cuz I only
spent about 2 1/2 hours on the whole thing, so there's no point in taking
the time to write a dedication to someone that's actually worth dedicating
it too... not that Reijin isn't worth it, cuz he's pretty damn good gay
cybersex0r... or so I've heard, I don't know from experience!

------------------------------ INTRODUCTION -----------------------------

 Ok, so it's not much of a translation, but it's a damn 'leet game. You
 play as some mutated Q-bert wannabe and you have to run around and save
 all your boogers while avoiding tons of enemies and making sure to leave
 a path to the escape door which is inconveniently located wherever it'll
 be the biggest pain in the ass to reach.

 The ever elite Tukka Yoot & myself did a review of this game many moons
 ago on my old site The Arsenal. It ended up being the first & only ROM
 of the Randomly Determined Period of Time, so I've included that review
 for your reading enjoyment. Also, thanks to Toma for lending me the font
 without his knowledge.

-------------------------------- HISTORY --------------------------------

 I got really bored, felt the urge to do a title hack and grabbed this
 ROM because it's a really kewl game and I figure maybe a few ppl might
 play it this way that might not have even heard of it otherwise.

--------------------------------- TOOLS ---------------------------------

 The following tools were used for this translation:

  Hexposure: hex editing for translation and graphic maneuvering
 Tile Layer: graphics hacking
   Nesticle: some graphic hacking
  SNES Tool: patch creation
  
-------------------------- PATCHING INSTRUCTIONS ------------------------

 Patching a ROM is extremely simple. You need three things. A ROM,
 the patch and a patching program. To patch with IPS, you simply
 type "ips <ROM name> <patch name>". So if the name of the ROM was
 HKFS.nes you would type "ips HKFS.nes HKFS.ips" and your ROM is now
 in English. Make sure you have all the files in the same directory
 if you have a problem.
      To patch a ROM with SNES Tool, simply select USE IPS, choose
 the patch and then choose the ROM to affix the patch to. It's self
 explanatory. If you can't figure it out, the game is probably too
 hard for you anywayz.
