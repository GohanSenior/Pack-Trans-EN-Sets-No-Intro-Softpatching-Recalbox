J.League Winning Goal is a soccer game for the NES. I'm not really a soccer fan, but I guess the game is alright. Anyways, I gave this game the works so go ahead and try out the complete patch now.

There's some attribute table wackiness going on, but it's for only one part of the game. I also didn't bother to expand the character limit for the player names. If turns out that I missed some stuff/screwed something up, I'll expand it next time.
