|ABOUT|
'''''''

Darian Kondura originally started to work on this rom to improve his
new found ROM hacking skills. After 3 days of work he gave me the ROM
to help him hack one part of the game he was having some trouble with.
I ended up hacking a bit more than that too teach Darian some
techniques. He had to pick a Namcot game programmed by a bunch of
monkeys :P This ROM used Ballzy tables which are sorta new to me too so
we both learned something out of this project. Script dumps were not
required as there is very little text in this game. So DDS just
translated some screenshots and that was that. This project took only a couple weeks to complete so don't expect some epic RPG here, just some weird action/RPG type game with barely any text. This project was just for educational purposes but we're distributing it anyway :) Enjoy!
