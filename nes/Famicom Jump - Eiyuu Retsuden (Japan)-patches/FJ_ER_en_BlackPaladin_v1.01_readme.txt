-BlackPaladin's Famicom Jump: Eiyuu Retsuden Translation Patch-
---------------------------------------------------------------

******************************
*Famicom Jump: Heroes History*
******************************

For those who don't know, Famicom Jump: Heroes History is the first of a long line of game series that combines characters from multiple anime/manga series into one single world.  This game was released in time to celebrate Weekly Shonen Jump's 20th anniversary, so characters from various manga series at the time were included here in one virtual world.  (That means no One Piece, Yu-Gi-Oh! or Naruto.)

You play the role of a boy who was sucked into a Jump Magazine and is immersed in "Jump World".  You must save "Jump World" from Piccolo Daimaou and gather sixteen heroes from within "Jump World".  (If you don't give your character a name, he will be automatically named "Hash".  That's because in the original ROM, the default character name was "Hashimoto".  It was shortened to "Hash" due to ROM limitations.)

Patching Instructions:

The patch comes in two flavors...

Famicom Jump - Heroes History (English).ips
--This patch requires a clean an unaltered "Famicom Jump: Eiyuu Restuden" ROM (IPS Format)

Be sure to use either patch on an NES ROM (393,232 bytes) with a header.  Where to find said ROM is up to you.  I cannot tell you where to look for it.

The ROM has to have the following hashes:
