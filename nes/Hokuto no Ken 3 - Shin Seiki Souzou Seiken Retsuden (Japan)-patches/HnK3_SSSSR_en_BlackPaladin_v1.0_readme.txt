-BlackPaladin's Fist of the North Star 3 Translation Patch-
-----------------------------------------------------------

****************************************************
*Hokuto no Ken 3: Shin-Seiki Souzou Seiken Retsuden*
****************************************************

The first two Fist of the North Star games were beat-em-ups on the NES.  When the third game was released, Bandai/TOSE went with a different direction... releasing a Fist of the North Star role-playing game!  This game's story encompasses the entire original anime series.

Also, some martial art names were left as romaji as the translated names were way too long.

Hokuto Shinken: Divine Fist of the North Star
Nanto Seiken: Sacred Fist of the South Star
Nanto Muon Ken: South Star Silent Fist
Nanto Roku Seiken: Six Sacred Fists of the South Star
Nanto Koshuuken: South Star Lone Eagle Fist
Nanto Suichouken:  South Star Waterfowl Fist
Nanto Koukakuken:  South Star Crimson Crane Fist
Nanto Ho-ohken:  South Star Phoenix Fist
Nanto Hakuroken: South Star White Heron Fist
Nanto Goshasei:  South Star Five Chariot Stars
Hokuto Ryuuken:  Lapis Lazuli Fist of the North Star
Hokuto Souke:  Originator of the North Star

Also, due to text display limitations, many technique and vital point names had to be truncated to eight letter maximum to be viewed correctly in menus inside and outside of battle.  However, the technique and vital point names has a text display limitation more room for display in the text box during battle messages. (The aforementioned text box has a display maximum of twenty characters, so I trimmed a few down to, at most, nineteen characters per technique/vital point name in the battle text box during enemy and boss battles.
