I was taking a brief break from one project when I decided to take this little project on.  It's a simple title screen translation patch for Metafight.  For those who don't know, this game was localized and moderately edited under the name "Blaster Master".  

So, there's no frog named Fred.  There's no mutants buried underneath Earth.  This takes place on a faraway planet called "Sofia the 3rd" in the Espilon Galazy, where the Ivem Dark Star Army, ruled by Goez wants to take over the planet.  However, a tank called "Metal Attacker", piloted by Kane Gardner (His name wasn't "Jason") was fight the evil army and save "Sofia the 3rd".

The patch comes in two flavors...

Super Planetary War Chronicle - Metafight (English).ips
--This patch requires a clean and unaltered Metafight NES ROM (IPS Format)
Super Planetary War Chronicle - Metafight (English).bps
--This patch requires a clean and unaltered Metafight NES ROM (BPS Format)
