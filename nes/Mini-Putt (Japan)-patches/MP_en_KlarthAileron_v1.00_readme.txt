I. The Game
--------------------
- It's a cracked out, difficult, and yet strangely addicting 
game of mini golf, and it has good music.

--------------------
II. Project History
--------------------
- I wanted to find an extremely difficult, time consuming, and 
challenging game to translate.  Mini Golf seemed like the 
perfect candidate.. b/c most of the game was already in 
english.  So, after playing for several hours trying to beat 
par (and I did... on a hole or two), I came to the realization 
that I'd never beat the game, so I'd never get to see if there 
was any ending text or credits or other stuff in Japanese.  So 
I went through the game with a couple of programs and saw no 
japanese whatsoever besides the title screen.  So I translated 
the title screen (gee, really hard.. it's the title of the 
game!), editted the tiles to make an extremely poor title 
graphic, and made the patch.
End of story.

--------------------
III. Completed
--------------------
- To the best of my knowledge, everything.

--------------------
IV. Incomplete
--------------------
- Nothing, hopefully.  May make the title screen prettier 
sometime, though.

V. Thanks

- Ballz, Shih Tzu, Gideon Zhi, Mr. Saturnine, Naflign, and 
(wraith), for replying to my thread on the Whirlpool's message 
board..  Without the help, I wouldn't have known whether this 
was a translation or a hack, what to do with softcore porn in 
translations, or the fact that Umihara Kawase rocks.

- The Whirlpool (http://donut.parodius.com), RPGd 
(http://rpgd.emulationworld.com), and all the other cool
translation/emulation sites I regularly visit.

- final exams for summer school, for giving me the drive to do
something creative other than studying.

- my computer, for not completely dying yet.

- all other people out there who helped or encouraged me, or 
who are just cool people.
