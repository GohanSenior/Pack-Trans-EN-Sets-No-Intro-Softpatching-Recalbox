About
~~~~~
This is a 100% complete translation of Valis (NES).
Intially released ten years ago, I was informed of
a game crashing bug related to two statues in the
Ruins level when using the Hammer item. This
update fixes that issue.

Usage
~~~~~
This translation was based on the ROM known as
"Valis - The Fantastic Soldier (J)" in the
GoodNES set. Usage of any other ROM version
may result in glitches or other strange errors.


Misc.
~~~~~
I find this game to be pretty poor do to some terrible
design flaws, so I took it upon myself to correct a lot
of them. These hacks are a part of "Valis++", which
contains the translation plus a multitude of hacks
to make the game *FAR* easier to play.

Please check either my homepage or ROMHacking.net
(http://www.romhacking.net) for this version of
the game.
