The Glory of Heracles 2: Titans' Downfall
        by toma and friends

!-*Completed patch version 1.31*-!

What this time?! You couldn't warp to Loran, and now you
can. Nothing big, but it was an inconvenience for sure.
I noticed this playing through the game again in PocketNES
and figured it was worth fixing. I also fixed a couple of
translation goofs here and there, nothing big. Enjoy!

Game Info:

The game rocks. That's all there is to it. That's
why I started my first attempt, and that's why the
second attempt worked. Yeah. The game is very DQish,
and it's sort of a cross between DQ2 and 3, so all
you DQ fans can either jizz your pants or dis DECO
for ripping off the DQ game system for a game. But hey,
it's done. It's the first "big" project (RPG) I've ever
actually finished translating, so I'm really proud of
myself. I've been working on it for over two years,
so all I can say is that you had all better like it!

So here's the kind of instruction manual-esque stuff.
I didn't try to get all the descriptions and stuff, because
to tell the truth, I don't even know what everything in
this game does. Maybe if I had a japanese manual I could
translate it too, but I don't. The game is fully playable
and beatable and stuff, so that should be good enough for
anyone, just think of it as an old game you picked up at
a yard sale and you'll be fine... ^_^

Walkthrough:

This isn't realy a walkthrough, it'll just get ya started
on the right track and help you through the first town,
which people seem to have a problem with. First off, you
can't name your main character (or any other character for
that matter) "Herac". This is because your main character
IS NOT Heracles, and the name is reserved for later on.
Now, on getting through that town. First thing of all, after
you talk to the blue haired girl, you have to talk to the
guy walking around way off to the left of her in order to
give her a name. Then go to the house in the south-east
corner of town and look under the bed upstairs. It's pretty
much self-explanatory after that, and even that isn't all
too hard to figure out on your own. So anyway, spoilers are
bad, so play the game and have fun!
