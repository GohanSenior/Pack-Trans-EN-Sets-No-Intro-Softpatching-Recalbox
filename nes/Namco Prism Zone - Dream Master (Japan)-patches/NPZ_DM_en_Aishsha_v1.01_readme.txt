Dream Master
======================================================
This game was a long-running project (first, due to
hacking issues, than - due to real life). Anyway,
it took like 50kb of new code and some serious work
with the text, but it's finally finished.

The game itself is a project of Birthday (the company
that worked on Kaijuu Monogatari) and has no relation
to the "Little Nemo" game for the same platform.

The story itself is quite simple from the first glance,
but the more you play this game, the more it shines
in every aspect.

This visuals are freaking awesome for that time and
the gameplay system is very unique (I did notice some
elements from Druaga series). 

This project is really worth your efforts and do buy
the original, if you like it.

SPECIAL NOTICE
======================================================
You may face some slight glitches during gameplay, but
that was the only way to make the translation as it is.
So don't worry about moment-twitches of the screen
during text-loadings routines or item sprites,
appearing in wrong places after use - nothing can be
done with those at the moment.

The game is VERY capricious with emulators and I cannot
guarantee it will work on real hardware as I have no
opportunity to test that. The best emulators to play
it so far are: Nester (ideal), fceuxdsp-1_0. You can
also try the latest FCEUX version, but it runs this
game with slight glitches due to specific original
mapper changing routine.

I'd very grateful, if you send me reports about bugs
or glitches found during gameplay, but please, do not
forget to add some descriptions, savestates and names
of emulators you use. (screenshots would be useful
as well).

The Version 1.01 has some misspellings gone and
some other misc glitches removed.
=====================================================
