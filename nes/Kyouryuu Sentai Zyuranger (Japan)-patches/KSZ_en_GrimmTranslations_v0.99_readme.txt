Kyouryuu Sentai Juuranger
Patch Version: 0.99

How to patch:
Grab your favorite patching program (I use Lunar IPS), as well as an
unmodified original Japanese version
(GOODNES name Kyouryuu Sentai Juuranger (J)).
Once you have both, open up the program, and select Apply IPS.
Select the patch (Zyu.ips) and apply it to the original ROM.

Fire it up in your emulator, and enjoy.

Note: This game has only been tested in the FCEU emulator. I can't garauntee it works in any other emulator.

Special thanks to: Redcomet, and Eien ni Hen.
