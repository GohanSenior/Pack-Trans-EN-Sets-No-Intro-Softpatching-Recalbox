-BlackPaladin's Ushio & Tora: Shin'en no Daiyou Translations Patch-
-------------------------------------------------------------------

******************************************
*Ushio and Tora: Great Demon of the Abyss*
******************************************

For those who don't know, Ushio and Tora is a long running manga series run by Kazuhiro Fujita.  It was later adapted into 10-chapter OAV series (Licensed by ADV Films in 1998) and a 39-episode TV series (Licensed by Sentai Filmworks in 2015).

It all starts when Ushio Aotsuki is told the story behind his heritage by his father, Shigeru Aotsuki, for the umpteenth time and warning him not to open the basement door.  Of course, he ignores his father's advice and finds a hidden basement where a monster dwells inside that's been pinned to the wall with an enchanted spear called "The Beast Spear".  Ushio reluctantly pulls the spear to free Tora... and the rest is history.

This game is a somewhat abridged story of the manga series from the initial meeting between Ushio and Tora to the final battle against the infamous "Hakumen no Mono".  (Some characters and chapters from the original manga were omitted from this game:  Gamin, Ayakashi, Kirio & Kuin, etc.)
