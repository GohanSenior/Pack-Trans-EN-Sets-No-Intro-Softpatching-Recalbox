1. Introduction

--------------------------------------

DBZ:AotS (as it will be referred to from now on.
Was the first Dragonball Z game EVER, and was
largely based on the Dragonball games that had
come before it. They both use nearly the same
battle system and movement systems. It was
released in 1989 and marked the painful beginning
of the DBZ saga on Famicom. There's 2 more
after this one and then a sidestory. Go figure.

Use your favorite IPS patching program and apply this
to a CLEAN copy of the Japanese rom.

2. Patch History

-Version 1.01
 There were a few bugs in the Tournament mode
 that caused it to do a number of things that
 hindered one's ability to play it. All of these
 bugs are now fixed. Also, the translation credits
 have been added to final credits at the end of the
 game. I also fixed Bandai's crazy Engrish in the
 credits, too. This patch is the final version.

-Version 1.00
 Everything is in and working properly. The only
 thing that hasn't been tested is the Tournament
 mode (Tourney in the patch due to space and
 motivation issues). I don't really think anyone
 cares about the Tournament mode too much; so, 
 unless someone playes it and finds some bug,
 this will probably be the final patch.

-Version 0.99 Feb. 1, 2003
 Initial release. 99% if not 100% of the text is
 translated.

This project would probably not have turned into
what it has today had it not been for the help of the
following, wonderful people (in no particular order):

-Myself(RedComet): All of the programming, script editting, and
 insertion was done by me.
-MukiMuki(Kamaitachii): The translator.
-MO's Board: Saved my ass many a time. 
-Elf: He created that ass kickin' English subtitle for me.
-Danke
-DodgyAussie

Version 0.99:

-Myself: Hey, without me there would be no patch. :P
-Kamaitachii: The translator who so graciously retranslated
 a script because I screwed it up to begin with.
-RougePaladin Trian & Vorpy: They both did there far share
 of script editing to make the scripts fit in the limited space.
-The guys at MO's board: Without these guys I probably wouldn't
 have been able to get some of this stuff translated as quickly.
-MO: For make the Translation board.
-Gil: For doing some ASM hacking (not present in this patch), and
 for being a really fucking cool guy in general.
-The guys at #gametrans over on DALnet: Just some pretty cool
 fellows to sit and talk with when you're unwinding after a long
 day of work.

And lastly, I'd like to thank anyone I might have forgotten to. Thanks you guys,
without you, this patch wouldn't have been possible. Cheers!
