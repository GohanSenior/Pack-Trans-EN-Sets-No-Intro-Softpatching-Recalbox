Game Information
------------------

Mashin Hero Wataru Gaiden is a game based on a popular anime
series known by the same name minus Gaiden. In this game you
play as yourself and you must save Wataru who has been captured
by the evil Dakdar.

The game is fun and interesting in the fact that it is an
action game but also has RPG elements that flow very nicely
together. The map is overhead view similar to other NES RPG's
of it's time while the battles switch over to a side view
based screen similar to Zelda 2. It's too bad it was never
brought to the US as I'm confident it could've done very well
but since we never got the show over here I suppose that makes sense.

You'll travel the world doing various tasks and trying to locate
the Dragon Treasures in order to save Wataru. Each area has its
own theme as well as enemies which adds to the overall charm.

Translation/Hacking Notes
-------------------------

By Hubz

This is a hack I started many years ago before I knew much about rom
hacking and it never progressed too far. Later after finishing Castle
Quest pennywise contacted me and revamped and improved the Castle Quest
translation quite a bit while teaching me various rom hacking techniques.
With those I began to start hacking Wataru again and got much farther.

I contacted tkcne to help translate the game and due to his prior experience
with ASM he began to hack Wataru and helped speed up the process immensely. 
There is no way the translation would have been completed without his expertise
in the amount of time, nor would it likely be as well done.

There are likely bugs (of course) but we have tried to catch them all. If you
come across any please contact me at hardcorehubz@yahoo.com and we will likely
release an additional patch once enough bugs have been found. Of course any
game breaking bugs will be fixed immediately but there shouldn't be any.
