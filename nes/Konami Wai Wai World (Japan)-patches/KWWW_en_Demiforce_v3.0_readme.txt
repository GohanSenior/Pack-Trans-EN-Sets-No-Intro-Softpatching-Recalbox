"The translation is essentially the product of 2 days of boredom and a
 smattering of wewetata pmk."

NEW IN THIS VERSION:

VRC  - I'm told a new version of nesticle is coming out soon, and
       it may support the original VRC mapper konami world was meant
       for. so, i copied the CHR and text banks to the NEZ file and
       here it is. there are no improvements from version 3. lelelele

3.00 - changed character 'ciman' to 'spice' (it fits better with
       cinnamon) 
       extended getsufuu-maden to its full name
       fixed spice's reincarnation text 
       added a line or two of spice's reincarnation dialogue 
       added the 'bad' card text in the card game
       drew in the 'later!' text graphic
       translated kong's 'hey!' cage message


2.00 - fixed the dice game dialogue. in 1.00, i had really no idea 
       what they were trying to say (the game is a complete nigger
       to translate) so i just threw in some confusing nonsense.


1.00 - initial release. about 80% complete, although i will need
       sardu to fix a few bugs in the mapper emulation to be able
       to see all of the game, so it's not all done yet.



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------



  This documentation will probably never be passed around with the intended
  ROM after one or two couriers through the emu 'scene', so i'll try to make
  it as pointless as possible for your spontaneous arousal.
 
  i started work on the evening of the 19th, and by the evening of the 
  20th (right now) i'm about 80% thru. i'll release it when it's all good 
  and done. the translation was done 100% by me, Mr. 1 year of college 
  Japanese, so don't bother sending me bug reports about how it isn't 
  entirely accurate. it's pretty late right now, and i've been working 
  on it all day. Hey! i got a good idea. if anyone can guess what font
  i stole to build this one's, i'll mail you a circuis peanut, or something..
  depends what i find.. no promises..
  
  this morning, i had set out to make it as fluent as possible, but as 
  the hours wore on, my inevitable freakish sense of humor found its way 
  into the translation, and so you people now have a slightly messed up 
  translation where people curse at you, and generally give you an 
  uninspiring message in whole towards your goal (not to mention the 
  subtle use of a few shmooze points here and there). 
  
  oh! i almost forgot. don't even think of trying to use the password 
  function. the password uses the japanese alphabet, which has more 
  symbols in it than english does. so, you'll get some normal looking
  letters in your password, and some really fucked looking ones. but,
  chances are you're using a capable enough emulator that allows real-time
  saves, so it shouldn't be a problem.
 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------



APPLICATION:

  to apply the patch, you need to have a trained NES format rom 
  which is 262160 bytes long. if your japanese konami world rom isn't
  262160 bytes, then you've got problems. just run the 'apply' batch
  program with the contents of this archive and the japanese rom both
  in the same directory and it'll patch it lickety split. 
 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------



CONTROLS:

  there are a few points you should know that aren't entirely obvious
  when you play the game. jumping and punching are the normal A and B,
  but then you have these few:

  DOWN     ... press to go into 1 of the 3 doors in the beginning
               (not up like you'd expect, eh)
  
  UP       ... press up to go into the little doors within the levels
               that lead to betting games.

  DOWN + B ... press when on a teleporter to warp back to the base.
               also, press down + B to open a cage door and release
               an ally when you have a key.

  UP   + A ... press to switch characters while in a level.

  DOWN + A ... press to switch from normal attack to item attack
               (if your current character has an item to utilize)



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------



STORY: 

  the story's pretty cool, actually. as with games like parodius, konami
  felt it needed to parody itself a bit to keep its audiences entertained.
  So, they created this game which contains characters from multiple other
  previously released konami games, excluding the central characters konami
  man (who did a camio in goonies 2) and konami girl. 

  Dr. Cinnamon cries for help, as the enemy forces from planet Gradius are
  trying to take over Konami World! not only have they succeeded in making
  him hysterically mad (he swears at you a lot :) but they have immobilized
  the only 6 forces capable enough to defeat them! 

  quickly, Konami man jumps into the action. Along with the android, Konami
  Girl, that Cinnamon provides, they set off to rescue the 6 allies and
  reclaim their Konami World!



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------



GAMEPLAY:  

  the gameplay is pretty much like a konami megaman. for every level that 
  you 'complete', you find one character, and are able to use his abilities
  till the end of the game. the last level is a shooter level, where you 
  can choose to be twinbee or vic viper. along with the characters you can
  find, there exist harder to reach items that make the game a little bit 
  more interesting to play, and often times make the character a little more
  valuable. they are:

  Konami Man
   Relation: (None)
   Item: Beam Gun
          your normal gun-type thing. no surprises.
   Abilities: Flying Cape

  Konami Girl
   Relation: (None)
   Item: Heat Gun
          same kind of thing as Konami Man's, basically..
   Abilities: None

(use konami man and girl only as last resorts or if you have noone else,
 as they have no real distinguishing features and their musics suck!)

  Goemon   
   Relation: Goemon, Doraemon (I think eh)
   Item: No Fucking Clue 
   Abilities: He can open the flashing treasure boxes.

  Simon Belmont
   Relation: The Castlevania Series
   Item: Holy Cross
          Like a boomerang type thing. One of the best projectiles, but
          it takes away 5 bullets every time you use it.
   Abilities: Effective against vampires and undead.

  Gestu Fuu-Maden
   Game: Getsu Fuu-Maden (unreleased in USA)
   Item: No Fucking Clue
   Abilities: A Special Hadouken mastery enables him to have a higher
              number of enemy items stolen. (#@$!@)

  Mikey
   Game: The Goonies 1, 2
   Item: Slingshot
          a fast travelling projectile. 
   Abilities: His small body allows him to travel in places others can't.

  Kong
   Game: I thought it would be Donkey Kong, but that's not by Konami..
   Item: Bananas
   Abilities: Strength and jumping surpass all others.

(hey guess what. strength has 8 letters but only 1 syllable. cool eh)

  Maoi
   Game: The Gradius/Nemesis Series, Salamander, Parodius
   Item: A Flying Disc
   Abilities: No Fucking Clue

(fucking has 2)

  Vic Viper (Shooter #1)
   Game: The Gradius/Nemesis Series, Salamander, Parodius
   Item: Option (I think)
   Abilities: A variety of gun formations.

  TwinBee (Shooter #2)
   Game: The TwinBee Series, Parodius
   Item: Power punch
          if you've ever used TwinBee in Parodius, you'd know what I
          mean. it's kind of hard to describe.
   Abilities: Agility

P.S. that penguin guy that helps activate the teleporter came from the 
     games penguin adventure and antarctic adventure. he fucking rules; 
     they should have given him a better part. get the MSX version of 
     penguin adventure, it has ruley music. when you die, it says
     'god bless you'. i'm thinking that's some fucked up shit right
     there.. fuck yeah =]
