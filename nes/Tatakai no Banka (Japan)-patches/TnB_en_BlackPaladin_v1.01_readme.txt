-BlackPaladin's Requiem for Battle Patch-

******************
*Tatakai no Banka*
******************

I was bored one night while waiting for some other projects, so I came up with this quick patch.  This translate the Japanese game "Tatakai no Banka" (Requiem for Battle) in English.  For those in the English-speaking regions, this game was releaed as "Trojan".

Patching Instructions:

This translation patch comes in four flavors:

Requiem for Battle (English).ips
--This patch requires a clean and unaltered Tataki no Banka ROM (IPS format)
Requiem for Battle (English).bps
--This patch requires a clean and unaltered Tataki no Banka ROM (BPS format)

Requiem for Battle B (English).ips
--This patch requires a clean and unaltered Trojan ROM (IPS format)
Requiem for Battle B (English).bps
--This patch requires a clean and unaltered Trojan ROM (BPS format)

I recommend using Lunar IPS for IPS patches.  Flips can be used to apply IPS or BPS patches.

To apply whichever patch, use either the IPS or BPS patch (not both) on the following ROMs...

For the patches...
Requiem for Battle (English).ips
Requiem for Battle (English).bps

Use either patch on the ROM with the following hashes...

File CRC32: 8D9C612D
ROM SHA-1: 563786BE12F4C37C774FE1CAB41F362606211277

For the patches...
Requiem for Battle B (English).ips
Requiem for Battle B (English).bps

ROM SHA-1: 4ABE6B51844F9A884BD5ECE64AB0D2B5DBE0E16B

File CRC32: 17C1410D
