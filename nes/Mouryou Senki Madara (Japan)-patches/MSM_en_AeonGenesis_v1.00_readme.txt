1.About Madara
--------------
Madara is a nifty RPG for the Famicom/NES. It features sound
powered by the Konami VRC6 sound processor, and has one of the
best musical scores on the system. It's also a fairly lengthy
and challenging game! Do be sure to read the mini manual I've
packaged with the patch for a general explanation of the game's
systems.

2.Patch History
---------------

I don't even remember when I started working on Madara... years
ago, certainly. I remember groaning at the data storage (and I
still do, when I think back on it.) It's kind of nasty, but even
though the text dumped into over 120 individual files, Tom/DDS
stepped up to the plate, after years of no translation support
and failed translation support. Once he finished the script, I
wrestled the game into submission, and managed to produce a
fantastic-looking patch in a fairly short amount of time.

September 26, 2006 - Initial version 1.0 release.
