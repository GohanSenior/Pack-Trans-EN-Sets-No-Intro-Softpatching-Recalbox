an overview of the stories and charcters, and directions to navigate the dungeon levels and defeat the game.
 

Story:
Peacock King returns to Mt Koya temple with Asura, his rival Jukindo master Onimaru, and Zen master Kou Kaifou. A kidnapping at an archaelogical site and an unearthing of a strange folding screen unleash the 6th Deva King, embodied by the reincarnation of Civil war general Nobunaga and the eight saints. Phoenix, an elusive rogue monk has threatened to destroy the entire Mt Koya sanctuary with an army of the dead. The hachiyou, the eight sages of the lotus leaf sect, have warped the light world with the dark world, and the theft of a sacred Grail threaten to further plunge the world into chaos. Peacock King learns of his history: his mother the deity Jizo Bosatsu and a monk Jikaku, and his evil twin sister Tomoko, the Snake King. Peacock Must battle himself as well as his twin in the climactic finish.

Notes about the historical names in the battles:

***Organtino, Gaspare, Valignano, etc were missionaries who went to Japan in the time of Oda Nobunaga who aided him in his military conquests and in trade.      

Azuchi castle was Nobunaga's stronghold. Honnoji is the site of his last battle. 

Mt Koya is the site of Shingon monasteries and the Okunoin sanctuary. Kukai or Kobo Daishi of the sanctuary is one of the founders of this sect who wrote the Lotus sutra. Also Nobunaga Oda, his loyal page Ranmaru, and other notables Shingen takeda, Mitsuhide Toyotomi, and Hideyoshi are also buried there. 
 

***Miroku, monju, amida, kannon, hodou, heaven's drum, lotus king, fugen, are names of eight Shingon deities that reside on the Lotus mandala, known as as the Kongokai -"Form world") diamond Manadala. The ghosts of these deities are their illusions. The inside is the Sun Buddha Dainichi.
