4.Known Issues

1. In the quiz mode you will notice a very quick and temporary glitch which is due to important code being written after vblank. I was in the process of fixing the issue, but lost my motivation to do anything lately. The game's perfect besides that and I figured I'd just release. You'll probably never encounter it anyway.
