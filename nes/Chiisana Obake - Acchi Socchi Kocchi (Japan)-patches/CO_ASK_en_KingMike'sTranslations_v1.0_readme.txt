WHAT'S DONE
***********
The title screen was the only thing to translate. Only two words to translate, two words to de-Engrishize.
See, it was like a quiet afternoon, November 21, 2002. I drew the title and inserted it, but the tilemap
was slightly compressed. Uncertain about compression at the time, I left it, until I forgot it.
Suddenly, March 17, 2005. I just finished off the bulk of work on Kalin no Tsurugi, randomly
searching my compuer, and I finally noticed this translation lying around. 
So, I decided to ASM trace the game, and I figured out the compression, and got the tilemap fixed.
And I save it for a birthday release.

PATCHING INSTRUCTIONS
*********************
All you need to do is download any patch application program.
Use something like Lunar IPS. Open it, then choose the patch, and the unhacked Japanese ROM. Then apply.
If you've already run Lunar IPS once, all you need to do is double-click the patch, then choose the ROM
from the prompt.

****************
EMULATION ISSUES
****************
The game is mapper 1 (Nintendo MMC1). So almost any emulator on the planet will support it.

*****************
PLAY INSTRUCTIONS
*****************
Control Pad - move characters
Select - unused
Start - start the game
B Button - select powerup
A Button - use powerup

To start off with, push the control pad to start (I suppose it's worth nothing this is the only break you get
in the game. Pause buttons are for wimps!)

Run around the maze using the pad. You must completely rope off a power-up to obtain it. When all boxes are empty,
you win the level. Collect a password after every 4th sub-level. There are 8 stages total.

Power-ups:
Apple - 100 points.
Launcher - throw 2 at an enemy to temporarily stop it. Each powerup gives 20.
L - Line? - Another ghost appears, extending your rope length.
Speeder - each powerup increases the meter by 4.
Stopper - ????
House - Enter it to go to a bonus level.

Passwords will save your powerups, thankfully.
