1.About Esper Dream 2
---------------------
Esper Dream 2 is a fairly simplistic Action/RPG by Konami. The
game has our protagonist chasing the missing Rings of the Book
Worlds through a number of novels-come-to-life. Enemies in this
are symbolized by walking pawprints; should the character come
into contact with the prints, the scene switches to a battle
arena in which the player, an ally (if one is present), and the
enemies duke it out in similar fashion to a Zelda game.

A few (extremely minor) changes were made to accomodate screen-
space restrictions; since the name variable is four letters
long, the main character's default name in the Japanese version
("Mamoru") was changed to "Matt." Similarly, the esper powers
mostly underwent cosmetic changes:

Esper Beam -> ESP Beam
Esper Light -> Light
Esper Stop -> ESP Stop
Power Repair -> ESP Heal
Teleport == Teleport
Flash == Flash
Foe Call == Foe Call
Esper Barrier -> Barrier

Everything else retained its original name.

2.Patch History
---------------

Esper Dream 2 is a game I'd wanted to work on for a very long
time, but was not able to do until recently. A few months ago
I received some initial help from g8z et al. on shrinking the
16x16 font to an 8x16 font; their hack worked, but I was still
stuck with the original number of characters onscreen at the
same time, and there were other routines that needed changing
(although they shared the actual print code with the main
routine.) When DDS stepped up to the plate to translate, I
fixed the font stuff, and when he finished the script in a
week's time, I quickly got the rest of the game up and running.

As a slightly humorous aside, shortly after launching the beta,
my testers started to complain that the first boss was
unbeatable. This couldn't be right, I thought, as I'd already
played through the game in its entirety on my own. Sure enough,
though, the boss's HP was set to 65535 if its health ever
went negative. Turns out there was a checksum implemented to
prevent the editing of the title screen... I removed the check
and it worked fine, but still. Classic Konami, title checksums.

September 12, 2006 - Initial version 1.0 release.
