***********
INTROUCTION
***********
This is a side-scroller adventure game.
Designed by Japanese comedian Takeshi Kitano, it is infamous for being
one of the worst video games ever made.
It is said that the game was infact intenionally terrible as if the
whole intent is to play a cruel joke on the player.
Well, whichever, you can now play this legend in English.

WHAT'S DONE
***********
 Should be complete.

************
WHAT'S BUGGY
************
 I get the feeling there may be some hidden spots I missed testing the game.
 If there's a place with wrong text or misplaced windows, a FCEUX savestate
 right before the error would be helpful.

 Do note that the original game was a bit glitchy. I know sometimes the
 screen won't scroll far enough to allow you to access warp points.
 That is a bug in the original, and in some places may have even been
 intentional.

*********************
PATCHING INSTRUCTIONS
*********************
 The ROM will need to be expanded with a program such as nflate first.
 Expand the PRG-ROM.

 Either apply the IPS version of the patch to an original Japanese ROM,
 or use a program such as upset (from byuu.org) to apply the UPS version.

 And I suppose you know not to apply it to a pre-patched ROM.

 This translation was tested on the 1986 version of the ROM, but looking
 at the differences between the two, it should be compatible with the 1990
 ROM as well. (technically, the only visible difference seems to be the
 date on the title screen. The mapper code was also changed slightly.
 My guess is the 1986 version ran on a PCB with bus conflicts and the 1990
 version did not. The 1990 version also contains a small additional routine
 that doesn't appear to serve any useful function: it reads from some address
 like $4420 that is believed to be unmapped and then follows with a branch
 with a relative offset of 0 (which again appears to be a useless instruction).

EMULATION ISSUES
****************
 Not aware of any. Again, the bugs I am aware of were present in the
 original game and may have even been intentional.
