Latest Version:
I don't know how I could let so many typos end up in what was supposed to be the final release.
I've gone through the file a few times now and fixed a lot of typos/text overruns, hopefully they're all gone now.
The messed up status screen is still unfortunatelt there, but it should be good other than that now.


Previous Version koogly.moogly/older(2001-2003):
I know there's a problem with the status screen suring parts of the game, but not other parts. I haven't figured out why it's like that, and that's why it's not fixed. If there's any other problems, just email me.

Patch this to an untranslated version of the game and voila! Instant spagetti!
