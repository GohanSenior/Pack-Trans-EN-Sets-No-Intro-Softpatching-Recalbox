1.About Lagrange Point
----------------------
Lagrange Point is a sci-fi RPG for the NES. A biological catastrophe has
occurred in the series of space colonies collectively known as the Isis
Cluster, and after communications cease, Earth sends a recon unit to
investigate. Shortly after landing, the squad is ambushed by violent robots.
Their pilot, Gene, wakes up in an infirmary with his dying captain, whose
last words are to "find Stolte."

The game itself features multiple swappable party members, item fusion,
and a semi-linear plot (at one point the player is tasked with acquiring
three macguffins, but it's up to you which you go after in which order.)
Lagrange Point is unique among NES RPGs, the only game on the system to make
use of Konami's proprietary VRC7 FM sound hardware. As such, it's gained no
little notoriety for the quality of the music it outputs; whether the actual
compositions are to your liking is up to taste, but I can guarantee that no
other NES game sounds like this.

The translation itself is almost as old as the community that produced it.
The project originally belonged to J2E Translations; it was passed to Aeon
Genesis in... 2007, I think, after necrosaro disbanded J2E to focus on his
doctorate. It's also the very first game that Tomato did the script for.
His relative inexperience at the time unfortunately showed in the text, and
several of the strings needed to be doublechecked throughout the editing and
testing processes.

The game's text was originally compressed, with six bits of every byte being
used per character instead of all eight (25% savings in space.) By rewriting
the dialog engine we managed to get that up to about 33% (closer to 42% if
you only count the main dialog, which makes as full use of the changes as
possible) but it's still an awfully tight squeeze. Romhacker Pennywise
(http://yojimbo.eludevisibility.org/) helped move some of the game's data
around a bit, and we both worked on menu expansions to allow for twelve-
character item names instead of the original eight. I'm reasonably happy
with the final result.

4.Known Issues
--------------
--The name of the character last played persists in memory through reset.
  This will cause the game's name-entry screen to be prepopulated with a
  name each you start a new game after the first. This behavior does not
  negatively affect the game's execution in any way; I'm just noting it
  here as it is behavior not observed in the original Japanese game.
  (The techincal reason for this is that we're using SRAM as scratch
   memory for a longer player name, if you're at all curious.)

Quick ROM Info:
512KB (4mbit NES)

Simply use Lunar IPS (or an equivalent program for MacOS/linux) to apply
the patch to the ROM. Note that if you've patched previously and are
upgrading to version 1.01, you'll want to patch a clean version of the rom.
