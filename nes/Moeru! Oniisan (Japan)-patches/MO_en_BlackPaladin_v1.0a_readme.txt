*The Burning Wild Man*

"Moeru! Oniisan" is a gag manga and anime, created by Kenji Terada.  It's about a boy named Kenichi Kokujou who was lost in the wilderness as a toddler and rescued by an old man who taught him karate at a young age but clueless to modern life.  He later returns to his family after being absent for 13 years, and hijinx ensues as a result.

One of Kenji Terada's accomplishments include writing the scripts for the first three Final Fantasy games, among others.
