  First and only release, this only translates the title screen. :p The game
  has English text, and while it's a bit rough, it was good enough for 
  me. It's understandable, if a bit Engrishy. I started this today, and
  ended it today. La.

  This is NOT to be used on the FDS version of the game. I wanted to hack
  that one first but the audio on that thing is crappy. FDS has superior
  hardware? My tails it has...

  Title screen hacked.

What's left
-----------------
  Nothing... or so it would seem.


Game Notes:
-----------------
  In case you're wondering, Upa [our hero!] also appears in a few of the Parodius
  games, as well as Wai Wai World 2. He's a baby! And... he's got a rattle! And...
  he kicks ass! Well, he crawls, hits you with the rattle, and then kicks your ass.


Game Controls:
-----------------
  Left     - Makes your character move to the left.
  Right    - Makes your character move to the right.
  Up       - Not used.
  Down     - Not used.
  Select   - Not used.
  Start    - Pauses the game.
  A Button - Makes you jump. Depending on the time held, you jump higher/farther.
  B Button - Makes Upa shake the rattle.
             When you hit an enemy with the rattle, you fill him up with hot air, 
             and you can either jump on him to be able to reach higher areas, or hit
             him with your body to use him as a projectile. That's it.
