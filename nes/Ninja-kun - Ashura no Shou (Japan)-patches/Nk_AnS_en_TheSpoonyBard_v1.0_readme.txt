Toma's Dumb Little Story About The Transaltion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Well, I first played Ninja Boy on my friend's
76 in 1 cart and it was one of my favorites. =)
Anyway, I found Ninja Boy 2 and it's like 35 times
better than #1! Yahoo! Well, when I found out there
was a bit of Japanese text in the game I just
had to translate it. I guess it's the same sorta
story as demi and Twin Bee 3. Anyway, enjoy
what might very well possibly be the world's
smallest complete translation! =P

I didn't make this game, UPL Ltd did.  I don't want
the thing distributed with the ROM cuz that's just
bad and I'd never do it so you shouldn't cuz it's
illegal and all that crap.
Umm... how's that?
