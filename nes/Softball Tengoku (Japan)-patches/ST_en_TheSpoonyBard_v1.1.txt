-softball heaven v1.1

by toma

-v1.1

translated the 2 player amazon stadium screen cuz i
forgot to do it before. ah well, that's life.

-v1.0

the game is done, and i spent 30 seconds on the title screen
because i didn't feel like doing a quality hack like i usually
try to do... live with it.

-game info

so yeah, it's a baseball game where you can choose your own
teams using players which range from cute little animals to
mythical japanese creatures to monsters from horror movies
to (yes, he's actually there) mike tyson (maitaison in the
japanese one, you figure it out). anyway, it's a fun game,
so have fun and remember to wash your hands
