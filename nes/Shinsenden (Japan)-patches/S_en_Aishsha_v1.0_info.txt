Background and general info for Shinsenden universe.

The universe of Shinsenden is loosely based on a rather philosophical works
of a Chinese philosopher Ge Hong (283-343 AD). His works generally referred
to the way on obatining immortality through proper studying and learning.
Some of his works were later translated into Japanese and pretty much
adapted. Honcho Shinsenden or "Biographies of Immortals" was a compilation 
of fables and legends involving immortals who lived among ordinary people.
Anyway, backgrounds in this game are a sort of mix between Chinese and 
Japanese cultures of Heian period. The authors throw different religious and
fabulous events and heroes into a single pot, making a rather good story
in tyhe end. Well, for a NES game.

Encylopedia. 
==============================================================================
In this case, if comparing to Kitaro, I'll try to explain those 
names I had to shorten or transliterate due to technical reasons (see readme).
Some of them are still unknown to me so if you're willing to help with finishing
this mini-guide - I'd be much obliged for any comments. Here we go. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2-Senkan (baidosenkan) - have no idea about this one - wouldn't mind any help...

Arhat (Lohan) - in the sramanic traditions of ancient India (most notably 
those of Jainism and Buddhism), signified a spiritual practitioner who had – to 
use an expression common in the tipitaka – "laid down the burden", realising 
the goal of nirvana, the culmination of the spiritual life (brahmacarya). 
Such a person, having removed all causes for future becoming, is not reborn 
after biological death into any samsaric realm.

Armakuri - it's a pun. Armakuri=Armoured Karakuri (see Karakuri).

Azatofu (along with Yogsotofu) - seems to be a parody of Yog Sothoth and 
Azathoth respectively (by changing the "thoth" to tofu). Tofu is a traditional 
Japanese bread.

that's it.  

Bakuenryuu (lit. "burst dragon") - dragon-like enemy.

Byakko - or "White Tiger" - During the Han Dynasty, people believed the tiger 
to be the king of all beasts. Legend had it that when a tiger reached 500 years old, 
its tail would turn white. In this way, the white tiger became a kind of mythological
creature. It was said that the white tiger would only appear when the emperor ruled 
with absolute virtue, or if there was peace throughout the world. Because the color 
white of the Chinese five elements also represents the west, the white tiger thus 
became a mythological guardian of the west. One of friendly NPC's.

Chimi - Small ghastly being. Generally, it's a mountain Youkai shown as a small
one-eyed mushroom in the game.

Daitetsujin (lit. "great iron man") - robo-like enemy.

Donburi - also frequently abbreviated as "don", thus less commonly spelled 
"domburi") is a Japanese "rice bowl dish" consisting of fish, meat, vegetables 
or other ingredients simmered together and served over rice. Donburi meals are 
served in oversized rice bowls also called donburi. Donburi are sometimes called 
sweetened or savory stews on rice. Have no idea why they called a monster this
way as I haven't seen it...

FBlowBug - Fireblow Bug. 

FireCent - Fire Centipede - nothing to explain here.

Genjutsu (lit. "illusion techniques")- master of illusion techniques that use the
chakra in the victim's nervous system to create illusions. The most commonly seen 
genjutsu in the series is the simple creation of phantasms causing the targeted 
person(s) to hear, see, smell, taste or feel sensations that are not actually 
there in order to manipulate them. Most genjutsu affects the five senses, though 
other applications of genjutsu exist.

Hanbou (lit. "half-staff") - a quarterstaff used in martial arts. Traditionally, 
the hanbou was three shaku (90 cm) long, exactly half the length of the usual staff, 
the rokushakubou ("six shaku staff"). As with any weapon, bearers would often find 
one best suited to their build, opting often for one that comes up to about 
waist/hip height.

with the fingers interlocking. When the fingers are interlocked on the outside,

inside, it is called naibaku (lit. "inner bind"). 
(jishi - lion or maybe other symbolic creature).

in Chinese mythology. It's also a legendary general in Chinese mythology. One of 
the main villains in the game.

astronomical calculations. It's a 2-head snake in the game though.......

silk or haku was used for paintings and calligraphy (called hakusho). Generally, 
the subjects of these paintings were Buddhist, depicting cosmology, mythological 
tales and religious rituals. Many such paintings, dating from the Han Dynasty, 
were discovered in the Ma Wang Dui tombs at Zhang-sha.

toward the good of humankind.

Kyonshi (lit. "stiff corpse") - sometimes called Chinese vampires by Westerners, 
are reanimated corpses that hop around, killing living creatures to absorb life 
essence from their victims. Jiangshi is pronounced goengsi in Cantonese, gangshi 
in Korean, and kyoushi or kyonshi in Japanese. They are said to be created when 
a person's soul fails to leave the deceased's body, due to improper death, 
suicide, or just wanting to cause trouble.

under the sea built out of red and white coral, from where he controlled the tides 
with magical tide jewels. Sea turtles, fish and jellyfish are often depicted as Ryu-jin's 
servants. Ryu-jin was the father of the beautiful goddess Otohime who married the

Seioubo - The Queen Mother of the West is an ancient Chinese goddess 
whose origin can be traced back to oracle bone inscriptions of the 
fifteenth century BCE that record sacrifices to a "western mother". 
Even though these inscriptions illustrate that she predates organized 
Taoism, she is most often associated with Taoism. From her name 
alone some of her most important characteristics are revealed: 
she is royal, female and is associated with the west. 
The growing popularity of the Queen Mother of the West, as well as 
the beliefs that she was the dispenser of prosperity, longevity, 
and eternal bliss took place during the second century BC when 
the northern and western parts of China were able to be better 
known because of the opening of the Silk Routes. 

Seiryuu - In Japan, the Azure Dragon (Seiryuu) is one of the four guardian 
spirits of cities and is said to protect the city of Kyoto on the east. 
The west is protected by the White Tiger, the north is protected by the 
Black Tortoise, the south is protected by the Vermilion Bird, and the 
center is protected by the Yellow Dragon. In Kyoto there are temples 
dedicated to each of these guardian spirits. The Azure Dragon is represented
in the Kiyomizu Temple in eastern Kyoto. Before the entrance of the temple 
there is a statue of the dragon which is said to drink from the waterfall 
within the temple complex at nighttime. Therefore each year a ceremony 
is held to worship the dragon of the east. One of the main villains in
the game.

been imported to Japan from Europe during the Meiji period.
