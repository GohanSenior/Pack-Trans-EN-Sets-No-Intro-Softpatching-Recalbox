SUPER XEVIOUS: THE RIDDLE OF GAMP (NES)
Translation by Psyklax
v1.0 (20170609)

This translates the game's subtitle (Gampu no Nazo) to
English (The Riddle of GAMP). There is no other Japanese
text in the game (the ending is already in English).
Concerning the transliteration of the Japanese "Gampu",
there appears to be some confusion. The ending gives it as
"GUMP", but the Xevious Wiki (for what it's worth) gives it
as "GAMP", meaning "General Artificial Matrix Producer".
Where they get that information, of course, I don't know,
but I'm willing to go with that. The "nazo" in the title,
incidentally, can mean "mystery" or "enigma" as well as
"riddle", but given the nature of the game - having to solve
some tricky puzzles to progress - means "riddle" is probably
a better translation. Other games with "nazo" have used
"mystery".

I think I've talked more than enough about this, given that
it changes six tiles and nothing else... :D So I'll leave it
here. Enjoy!
