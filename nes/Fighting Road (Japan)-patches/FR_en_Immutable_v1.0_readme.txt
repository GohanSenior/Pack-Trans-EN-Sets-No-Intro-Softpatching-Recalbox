This readme is written by Filler for submission of a translation patch to Romhacking.net. I had nothing to do with this translation. I found it linked from a YouTube video about the game. Below are the notes on the translation from the original YouTube video.

"Here is fan made english adaptation of the famicom game back from 1988. It's not 100% correct (I've made a few mistakes due to compilation to the video), but if you ever wondered what this game is all about - here it is - watch the story unfold!

Thanks to Game Dave for giving me enough courage to beat the game, thanks Vovan for scans of Instruction Manual. I wasted so much time when I was trying to put english text in the ROM of the game, so I said: "Fuck it." and just made a video. Also, go easy on some of the lines, 'cause it's have been translated from Japanese to Russian, an then from Russian to English. Something like that.

Beat the game under 15 min, it's very short, but have some cool graphics, animation and stupid-ass last boss with countless fireballs!

Ask me in the comments, if you don't get something about the story or characters, I'll do best I can to explain everything about this game."
