IKKI (NES)
Translation by Psyklax
v1.0 (20170601)

I'll keep this brief: this replaces the Japanese title with
an English transliteration. That's it.

The WWWJDIC Japanese-English dictionary defines Ikki as
"uprising (esp. in Japan since middle ages, e.g. peasant
uprising)". The arcade original gives a backstory to the
uprising, but since the NES can only support 32KB of
programming data and a mere 8KB of graphic data (later games
would use MMC chips to get around this problem), all of that
is gone. So the only Japanese text remaining is the title,
which I decided not to 'translate' due to the game's name
being known well enough (and easy to pronounce). Changing
the name would just add to confusion.

This was a very quick and dirty job, but hey, there's
another Famicom game translated. Sort of.
