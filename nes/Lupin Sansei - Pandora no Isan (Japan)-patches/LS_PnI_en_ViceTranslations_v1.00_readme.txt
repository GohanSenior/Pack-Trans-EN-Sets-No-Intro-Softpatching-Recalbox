 I'm finally done with this thing. W00t. All the in-game and cutscene
 is translated, and there's a title screen that little ol' me made.
 The Lupin logo is all pixelated, but it works. And I spent three or
 four hours on that stupid shot up logo SO BE THANKFUL FOR IT. Argh.

What's left:
------------
  Nothing!


Mini instruction thing:
-----------------------
Left/Right: Moves character
Up: Enters door
Down: Crouch
B: Attack
A: Jump
Up + A: High jump
Down + A: Go down a floor / level
Pad + A: Swim [in water]
Select: Use special tool
Start: Pause
Left/Right [while paused]: Choose special tool [Lupin only]

You can use three characters in this game: Lupin, Jigen and Goemon. They
all have different skills:

Lupin The 3rd: Lupin is the character that has the most tricks available.
He can use special goggles, go underwater, use a jetpack, a shotgun,
bombs, and save himself from falling down chasms with balloons. But, he
can't shoot while jumping, and can only shoot one bullet at a time. He
can also grab vests which protect him from being captured.

Daisuke Jigen: His gun has great reach, but he can't use any items other
than the call phone. He can shoot multiple shots at the same time, and
can shoot while jumping. Oh and if he falls on water, he dies. And he can
only be hit once.

Ishikawa Goemon The 13th: He's the strongest character in the game, but he
also has the worst reach of 'em all. His Zantetsuken can cut through almost
any enemy, and kills everything EXCEPT the bosses on one hit. Some enemies
can't be killed though, so watch out. He can only take one hit before being
captured.

Game Mechanics:
\\

You run, you kill enemies, you go in doors, you grab items [shoot the urinals
to get them... don't blame me, THEY LOOK LIKE URINALS], you evade Zenigata,
if someone gets captured look for them in the level otherwise you'll get them
back when you finish it... and uh, that's it.

<Kitsune_> and shott the peethings on every level for items
<Kitsune_> ... they look like urinals. :P
<Sardius> heh! they do, yes.

//
Special tools:
\\

Call phone: All three characters can use this. You use it to switch to another
character on the fly, at any time, except during a conversation. You can't
switch to a captured partner, obviously.

Ruby Ring: You'll need this to bribe some characters into helping you.

Lupin-exclusive items:

Vest: You'll be protected for one hit for each one you pick up.

Shotgun: Use this and you'll get a few three-way gunshots. But, you get
knocked back a bit when you fire the weapon, so be careful.

Goggles: They help you find traps in some stages.

Bombs: They destroy all enemies on screen and open doors and passageways.
Hint - use them on the fireplaces in stage one...

Jetpacks: Use them to fly around the stage. Get hit and you'll fall down.

Oxygen tanks: You need these to swim around. Some stages -require you- to go down
and swim.

Balloons: If you fall down a hole, you'll be saved by this. You can shoot
your gun and maneuver a bit while floating, but the balloon will pop after a few
seconds of flight.

<Sardius> kinda sucks that only lupin can use those subweapons, too.
<Sardius> not to mention the vests. :/
<Kitsune_> It's good, though, imagine a nigh-invincible Goemon :P
<Kitsune_> "I shall smite thee with my boomstick!"


Very special thanks to:
-------------------------
satsu - For letting me finish this project... two years after he started
 it.

Sardius - for being my only betatester and telling me of two crash bugs early
 in the game.

<Sardius> yay, I'm helpful!
