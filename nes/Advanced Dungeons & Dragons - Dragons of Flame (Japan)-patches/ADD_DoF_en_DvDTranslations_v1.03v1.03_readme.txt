                 for the Nintendo Famicom/NES

              Patch Version: 1.03
               Release Date: October 31st, 2003

Hello and welcome to the ReadMe file for
"AD&D DragonLance 2 - Dragons of Flame" for the NES.

In this file I've included info on how to use this patch,
how play control differs in this game from that of
"AD&D DragonLance 1 - Heroes of the Lance", and a rough
walkthrough.

How to Patch the ROM file:

Original Game ROM Size: 1 megabit of program ROM
                          &
                        1 megabit of character ROM
                      = 2 megabit
                      = 256 kBytes
                      = 262144 Bytes
You need:

1) A ROM file.  The file must include the standard 16 byte
   iNES header followed by the program ROM followed by the
   character ROM.  This makes the ROM file 262160 Bytes in
   size.

   I'm not telling you how to get the ROM file, but
   for this game, the format of the 16 byte iNES header
   should be:

   4E 45 53 1A 08 10 12 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

   Note:  The ROM file most commonly found on the internet

     AD&D Dragons of Flame.nes

   has a corrupt header file that doesn't allow the battery
   backup system to work!  Instead of the 12 it has a 10.

   Starting with patch version 1.00, if your ROM file has a
   header with a 10, it will be changed to a 12 by the patch
   which will allow the battery backup to work.

2) Patch File: DoF-v1_03.IPS - Included with this file.

3) An IPS patching program
   Recommended patching program for IBM PC:

    Snes-Tool.exe by The M.C.A./Elite

Using SNES Tool:

1) Make a copy of the un-patched ROM.  You always want to
   keep the un-patched ROM around for later revisions of
   the patch.
2) Place an un-patched ROM file with header (I'll call it
   DoF.nes), DoF-v1_03.IPS, and Snes-Tool.exe in the same
   directory.
3) Run Snes-Tool.exe
4) Type 'U' for "Use IPS"
5) Press the down arrow key until DOF-V1_03.IPS is
   highlighted.
6) Hit Enter.
7) Press the down arrow key until DOF.NES is highlighted.
8) Hit Enter.
9) Hit 'Q' to quit.

Note: If patching the file on a Mac, I recommend UIPS.

Why I, DvD, chose to translate any game:

   I wanted to give back to the translation community
   after playing so many excellently translated games
   such as Tales of Phantasia for the SNES by DeJap,
   Final Fantasy II for the NES by NeoDemiforce, and
   Final Fantasy III for the NES by Alex W. Jackson,
   Neill Corlett, & SoM2Freak.  I really appreciate all
   that have gone and translated before me.

Why I chose to translate THIS game:

1) I wanted to translate an action/adventure or RPG
   that everyone knew something about.  Yes, this game
   is the sequel to the infamous AD&D DragonLance - Heroes
   of the Lance, rightly voted one of the worst games
   ever released in the US for the NES.  What is
   amazing about this game is that all the things that
   made the original game so bad (terrible player control,
   no ability to regain health except using magic which
   is almost impossible to replenish) have been fixed in
   this game.  Try it out.  I think you'll be pleasantly
   surprised.

2) I've played and passed all the prequels to this game.
   It just has the one.  I have this thing about playing
   games that are part of a series in the order in which
   they came out...

3) This game only uses Hiragana and Katakana, no kanji.
   Plus it has a nice Roman character font on the same
   character table.

4) I wanted to do an NES game.  I have a lot of experience
   with machine language of the 6502 processor.

5) I liked the game and wished I could play it in English.

6) AD&D starts with A.  It was one of the first that I
   considered...

Why YOU should bother playing THIS game:

1) This is a COMPLETE translation.  I worked my ass off to
   make sure that ALL of Shiroi's translation made it into
   the final patch.  It was not easy.  I had to get pretty
   creative moving code around and filling in tiny unused
   portions of code with strings.

2) This is an accurate translation.  After Shiroi translated
   the script, I researched the correct spelling of all the
   character names and places in the HotL manual, the PC
   version of this game, and on DragonLance web sites.

3) See what a vast improvement this is over the prequel!

4) It's the only official D&D game, released on the Famicom,
   that wasn't released in the US; see what you're missing!

5) Its very different from the PC released version of this
   game.

6) It's quite short.

7) You won't get stuck or need a walkthrough...
   so why am I including one in the doc?

8) KlD says, "This game was enjoyable to play.  I'm more of
   a turn-based RPG player, but the action wasn't difficult
   and was actually sort of fun."

Why i, shiroi, chose to translate this game:

   i looked on the Whirlpool want ads and saw it. :o i chose
   this one specifically because it wasn't too big, and i'm
   something of a closet D&D fan. anyhow, then i got in
   touch with DvD and i was really struck by the amount of
   interest he showed in doing it right, as in adhering to
   the proper names and places. thus, i was motivated to
   whip through the script and do my best.
   please enjoy.

Game Controls & Tips:

1) If you haven't played Heroes of the Lance before, you
   should read it's manual.  Actually, the manual is the
   best thing about the game!  The story line and characters
   for this game are identical to the prequel.  The
   controls, spells, and items are similar but are improved
   in this game.  With a little research you should be able
   to find a text copy of the HotL manual on the internet.
   I own a copy of the HotL with manual, but before writing
   this I checked and I was able to find a text manual for
   the NES version of HotL on the net.

2) Controls

* Start    : Start the Game
             Display the Main Menu

* B-button : Swing your Weapon
             Cancel menu command
             Back up one menu
             Advance Text
             Speed Up Text - When possible

* A-button : Jump
             Select menu command
             Advance Text
             Speed Up Text - When possible

* Directional Pad

 + Overworld:

  - U,D,L,&R : Move character N,S,E,&W

 + Underworld or Fighting:

  - L & R    : Move character left or right

  - D        : Duck
               Pick up item
               Aim weapon down when swinging it
 
  - U        : Aim weapon up when swinging it
         
3) The Main Menu, Clerical Spells Menu, and
   Magic User Spells Menu scroll up and down. This is
   because they all have more items than can be shown
   on the screen at one time.

4) Use "Hero Select" to swap the position of 2 characters.

5) Rest often and swap first characters to keep your
   HP up.  After resting once, you'll a have to wait
   a while before it will let you rest again. In the
   overworlds, you cannot rest if you are in a
   battle.  In the underworlds, you cannot rest if there
   is one or more monsters in the hallway you currently
   occupy. The game lets you know if you successfully
   rested or not.

6) All characters start with 255 HP.
   Spell points are as follows:

Raistlin starts with 255 MP.

Spell               MP Used
------------------- --------
Charm                 16      See HotL manual

Magic Missile         16      "
Web                   32      "
Burning Hands         21      "
Fire Ball             32      Attack with a ball of fire

Goldmoon starts with 255 MP.

                              by 51 points (20% of 255)

Hold Person           16      See HotL manual

Spiritual Hammer       6      "

                              by 127 points (50% of 255)

                              by 204 points (80% of 255)

Raise Dead            48      Raise 1 dead character's HP
                              to 51 points (20% of 255)

6) To equip a weapon or a piece of armor, GIVE
   it to the person who you want to equip it on and then USE
   it while it is in that persons inventory.  If they can
   equip it, it will move from the items section to the
   equipment section.

7) To throw a projectile weapon, it must be in the items
   section of the character who wishes to use it.  Also,
   that character must be the first in the party.
   Select the projectile (arrow, pouch of bullets, javelin,
   etc.) with the USE command.  Only certain characters can
   use certain projectile weapons.  If it doesn't work for
   one character try it with a different one.

------------------------------------------------------------
Quick Walkthrough - Contains "spoilers":

   The goal of the first overworld is to make it to the man
   just north of the Pax Tharkas fortress in the far
   south west corner, Gilthanas.  Do this after meeting all
   the other men to follow the story, one of which gives you
   a Potion of Healing.

   The goal of the second overworld is to make it to the
   cave in the south west after visiting Theros in the cave
   in the north east.

   Both underworlds contain a number of useful items not
   listed here.

   The goal of the first underworld, Sla Mori, is to find
   the Wyrmslayer and then find the entrance to Pax Tharkas.

   The goal of the second underworld, Pax Tharkas, is fight
   the goblin, meet the first dragon, the Old Sage, defeat
   the second dragon, Ember, and then defeat Verminaard.
