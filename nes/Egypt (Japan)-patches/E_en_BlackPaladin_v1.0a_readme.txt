-BlackPaladin's Egypt NES Patch 1.0-
------------------------------------

*******
*Egypt*
*******

While waiting for other projects being worked on, I decided to work on this small and simple puzzle game.  In "Egypt", you play the role of a young adventurer (looking similar to Indiana Jones) who's exploring an unknown shrine until he discovers a large gem.  The gem is actually an avatar of a goddess who was trapped inside the temple.  Like the adventurer, the goddess is trapped. Her gem could unlock the many seals in the shrine but she cannot move the gem.  That's where the adventuer comes in.  He boards this gem and uses it to solve the many puzzles inside to free himself (and by extention, the goddess) from the cursed shrine.

The patch comes in two flavorsL
Egypt (English).ips
Egypt (English).bps

Use either patch (not both) on an unedited ROM with the following hashes...
