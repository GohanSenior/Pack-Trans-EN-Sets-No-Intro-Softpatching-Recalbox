INTROUCTION
***********
This is a dungeon crawler RPG, and the last of the series.
The first two were on the Famicom Disk System. You were a hero who
explored a large dungeon to find and defeat the evil villian inside.

The third game added multiple party members (including player-created members)
and multiple dungeons to explore.

This last game keeps the open world (much of the game is non-linear),
but it drops the custom character creation aspect. This one also drops the
party size effectively from 4 to 3. (at some points in the plot, you will
have one NPC member, but they won't participate in battles.)

Actually, one previous group, Dragoon-X, did translate this game before.
But shortly after I released the translation patch to the first game,
the original author asked to have that patch declared dead and incomplete.
I noticed that game did have serious bugs. So me and odino started work on
a fresh translation.

PATCHING INSTRUCTIONS
*********************
 Either apply the IPS version of the patch to an original Japanese ROM,
 or use a program such as upset (from byuu.org) to apply the UPS version.

 And I suppose you know not to apply it to a pre-patched ROM.
