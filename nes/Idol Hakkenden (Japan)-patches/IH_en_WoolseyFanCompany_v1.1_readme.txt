___________________________________________________________________________
	This translation/localization was created with love and care by
Polinym of the Woolsey Fan Company (W.F.C.). The original version was finished
on 9 / 3 / 2019. This patch ( "Pop Star Debut (USA).ips" ) is to be applied to an
ordinary, headered "Idol Hakkenden" ROM file.

	I, Polinym, have done my best to ensure that this localization
 is bug-free, however, there is a graphical issue involved in the ending credits / attract mode.
 During the opening/ending song, "Nova Girl" (U.S.) / "Kimiha Hoehoe Musume" (Japan), 
the collection of glitchy tiles appear. I am unsure at this time where the issue is located, but it 
should not crash the game or impact it in any way. An issue also exists if a line of text exceeds
16 characters, which will result in the text printing out past the box it is meant to stay in. 
If you encounter any line of the text in the game that goes outside the box,
please let me know somehow as soon as possible, for it is an easy fix.

	Unfortunately, due to space limitations, the songs in this localization have lyrics
that do not match up with the notes of the music. This applies to the "Song Time" songs
in regular gameplay and "Nova Girl" in the end credits. If you know of a solution to create
space for good lyrics, please contact me. I'm still very new to the Romhacking scene, so
there is much yet for me to learn.

	Lastly, thank you for playing Pop Star Debut! Feel free to let me know what you
thought of the localization, if I should change anything, or if you have ideas on improving
it. I hope you keep an eye out for more localizations by the W.F.C. If you have a game in mind
that you would like the W.F.C. to localize, please let me know!
