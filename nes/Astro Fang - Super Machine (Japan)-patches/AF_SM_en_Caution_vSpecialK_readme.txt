	INTRO
	-----

For thousands of years, man has dreamt of playing Astrofang in English.  Many a sad war could have been avoided by an English translation of this game but sadly there was none...   Until now.

	WARNINGS
	--------

Press "select" when you start playing to listen to sound-effects instead of that horrid music.  Trust me, the music is bad.  Almost evil in its horridness.
Also, please apply patch to the good dump of the game.


	GAME INSTRUCTIONS
	-----------------

(from memory)
UP - shoots
DOWN - changes car to thin and back
LEFT, RIGHT - steer
Buttons - Accelerate and brake.
