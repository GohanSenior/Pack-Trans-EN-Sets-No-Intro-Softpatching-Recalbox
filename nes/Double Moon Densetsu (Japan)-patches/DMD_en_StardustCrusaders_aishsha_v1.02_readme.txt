About The Legend of Double Moon
======================================================
Project History:

This project is perhaps one of our oldest projects.
aishsha originally translated the script for Bongo'
sometime in 2008/2009, but the project lingered and
eventually went dead. It was picked up by ourselves
a few years ago and we have seen it through to completion.

Some of the technical work is that of Bongo's doing like
the title screen, which he wrote tools for to deal with the
title screen graphic compression. He also implemented
a dictionary compression routine for the text. The rest
of the hacking was done by ourselves including numerous
code hacks for the best possible translation.

Eien ni Hen was also a great help with finishing this project.
She played through the game and edited the script for us.

I also fixed an original bug for the location warping of
this game. If you warp to the last location, you are sent
in the middle of mountains where you can't move instead
of the location you're supposed to go. This has been fixed.
There's also an original bug for item storage. The game allows
for a max of 7 pages of inventory, but on the last page,
the game starts to bug out. You'll only ever encounter this
if you go crazy storing items as the max limit is 48 items.
Instead of spending all my time trying to fix this, I decided
to decrease the total numbers of items to 42, which is enough
to fill up the 6th page and not allow you to go to page 7.
There's also another bug that allows you to equip 2 weapons
for 2 handed weapons if you equip them on the left hand.
I'm still on the fence about fixing this one though since
it's more of an oversight and doesn't affect the game too
much.

As for the game itself, it's your typical grindy DQ clone
for the NES. It's hard as hell and not for the faint
of the heart, but for those willing to give it a shot,
they might come away surprised because this game is more
than your average DQ clone.

The story borrows some elements from the DQ, but ends
up doing its own thing and becoming totally unique in the
process. The battle system also adds its own twist making
for a somewhat fresh experience. If you're not going to
cheat, you're gonna have to make use of the Aim function
to immobilize and weaken your enemies or else they'll
kick the crap out of you.

Game Hints
======================================================
*There are alternate dialogues for the different
classes you can choose.

*There are alternate dialogues based on when you
recruit Kreutz.

*There are alternate dialogues based on some of the
decisions you can make.

*You can get an alternate ending of sorts by killing
the Black Knights on the left and right.


======================================================
Known Bugs
======================================================
* Occasionally you will notice a small sprite appearing
on the battle screen. But it goes away and is minor.
Similar instances of that may happen during certain
battle stuff.

The game has its fair share of original bugs.
Below is a list of known bugs in the original game.

*With the special 2 handed swords, if you equip them
on the left hand, you can still equip something on
the right.

We would be highly grateful, if you find some time to 
contact us with proposals or corrections. Information
on found bugs or corrections would be highly 
appreciated.

P.S.

Support the game industry by buying used games!

Even if the money doesn't go to the developers
directly, as the games become rare and harder
to find, the price goes up, and people become
more inclined to buy new releases "while they can!"
