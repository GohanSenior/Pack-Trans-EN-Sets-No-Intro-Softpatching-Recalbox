Choujin Sentai Jetman English Version
Version 1.00
Released May 28, 2000

Introduction
------------

I still have a hard time deciding if this is should be called a translation
or merely a hack. But I guess if groups like Suicidal Translations can
translate Sanrio games which hardly have any text and call them translations,
I suppose I can do the same. =P


Installation
------------

Just use the patch like you would with any other patch. Get IPS.exe,
jetmanv1.ips, and the ROM for Choujin Sentai Jetman, stick them in the same
directory so it's easier, and type something similar to this at the MS-DOS
Prompt:

ips jetman.nes jetmanv1.ips

That should be it. Before I forget to put this in, there are also two
'secret' modes, Hard and Very Hard. Have fun finding them. They should be
easy to find.


Unresolved Issues
-----------------

Everything looks nice and neat, except in battle mode, the boss names didn't
fit, and I was too lazy to figure it out. The name of each boss is printed
nicely right here.
