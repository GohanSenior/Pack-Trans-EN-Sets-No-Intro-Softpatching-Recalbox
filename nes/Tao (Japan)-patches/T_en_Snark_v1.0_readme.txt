Your mother is glad that you were speaking the truth, and the ascetic monk from the waterfall says that Satori has opened and effrt is futile. Mara tells you that you have reached salvation.

Go off the screen. It is now black and the song continues. A bird in a cage appears. The pole shift occurs, which is signified by the reversal of the Crane and turtle on Judgement day. The bird flies from the cage and the song continues about Crane and Turtle. The old Buddha Tennen Kobutsu appears and grants the 3 gems and opens the one point way. The treasures appear and the end credits roll. Congratulations! :)

Lyrics from Fiery sunset. 

"Fiery Sunset"

The day ends with a fiery sunset

The mountain temple's bell rings

Let everyone go home, hand in hand


Lyrics from Kagome.

"Kagome kagome, the bird in the cage,

Will you come out?

In the evening of the dawn,

the crane and turtle fell

Who stands before you now?
