1.About Chaos World
-------------------
Chaos World is a bloody excellent RPG for the NES. It has all the
things that make today's next-gen RPGs great, without all the flashy
graphics and sound. And if you think flashy graphics and sound make a
game, then Chaos World is here to prove you WRONG.

2.Patch History
---------------
Chaos World started waaaaay back in the summer of '99, as my first
really big translation attempt. Xeur offered to translate the script,
and by sometime in October, had returned all of the smaller blocks and
all but one of the large blocks to me. At that point, he took a job in
Japan, and lost touch, leaving the last major dialogue block without
a translation. So I pieced together what I had, and released an almost-
playable patch to the masses. Unfortunately, there were a few fairly
major bugs - the guild text was messed up in places, and King Ruval,
when he was supposed to commission you to rescue Prince Levin from the
kidnappers early in the game, just sorta stared blankly at you. As a
result, the text-embedded story flag was never switched, and you could
not go any further ^^; There was also a bug in the battle text which
has since been resolved: In April or so of '00, Jair helped me with
some minor assembly modifications. Basically, we rearranged the
placement of monster names so that we could fit longer names in. After
that, the project was unfortunately rather dead in the water... that is
until Xeur resurfaced in January of 2001 and returned the last of the
script to me ^_^

5.Application Instructions
--------------------------
Download SNESTool from your favorite emulation utility site, and unzip
it to the same directory as your Japanese Chaos World ROM. Before doing
anything else, make an extra copy of the Chaos World ROM by right-
clicking it and choosing copy, then right clicking in a blank area and
choosing paste. Now let's say your original Chaos World ROM is called
"chaosw.nes". Double-click SNESTool, choose "Use IPS" from the menu.
Pick whichever version of the patch you wish to use on the ROM, then
pick the ROM itself. Load in your favorite emulator that's not LoopyNES
or NESticle or any of the other numerous emulators that don't support
Chaos World and have fun!

6.Translation Notes
-------------------
I figured I'd better throw this in here, 'cuz a few things were, in
fact, changed.

The main character's father had a name change. He's now "Mars" instead
of "Marvellous" which was just WAY too big.

In each of the regions, at least one townie said something to the
effect of "You're killing monsters as you travel? Wow!" I gave these
poor, unimportant souls the Working Designs treatment. See if you can
spot 'em ;)

Karlintz became Carlint because it was already hacked in before anyone
realized that it was a mistranslation ^^;

Droll Ogre has become Draw Omega, just because that particular
mistranslation RULED.

7.Patch Notes
-------------
What's the difference between the "a" patch and the "b" patch? Well,
when hacking the game about a year and a half ago, doing all sorts of
technical crap manually, I accidentally stumbled upon a bug that made
me laugh my head of. The solution was fairly simple, but I just loved
walking up to one townswoman in particular at the VERY beginning of the
game, and having her curse at you and throw you into a battle that you
can NOT win :D Of course, her text changes after speaking with the
King, so there's no way for you to power up before talking to her ^_^

Since I loved the bug, I figured I'd let the world see it. Apply the
version A patch and talk to the woman walking around by the gravestone
as soon as you start the game :) The version B patch is identical to
the version A patch (except that it doesn't have her bug) so they
should be hot-swappable without having to download a new ROM.

Enjoy!
