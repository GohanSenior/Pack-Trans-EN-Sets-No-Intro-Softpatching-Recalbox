-BlackPaladin's "Giant Monster Flaburas" NES Translation Patch-
---------------------------------------------------------------

********************
*Dai Kaijuu Deburas*
********************

For those unfamiliar, this is a turn-based strategy game where you control the Japanese military who are trying to protect a massive egg from a giant monster who's named "Flaburas".  An egg washes on shore after a typhoon struck Japan and the military decides to hatch the egg.  Unfortunately, the giant monster "Flaburas" emerges from the sea and tries to destroy the egg before it could be hatched.

This game has a kaijuu theme, so expect a lot of riffs from old films like Godzilla.
