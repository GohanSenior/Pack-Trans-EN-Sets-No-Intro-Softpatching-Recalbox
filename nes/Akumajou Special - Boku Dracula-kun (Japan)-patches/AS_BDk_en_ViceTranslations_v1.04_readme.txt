Project History:
-----------------
July 2, 2009
 I received some information from an emulator coder who told me that
 the hack that removed the protection from the game caused a crashing
 bug in his NES emulator. This was back in 2008, I just uh, kinda sorta
 forgot about it until earlier this month. Note that functionally there's
 no real changes between 1.03 and 1.04 - the only difference between
 both patches is two bytes. While the original patch worked on normal
 NES systems (via flashcart or repro carts), there's no guarantee that the
 same patch would work properly on clone hardware. Better safe than sorry!

 I also updated Scheurbert's website info! He was the guy who
 designed the English title screen and game ending screen. Go visit him,
 he's an awesome graphic designer who works out of Australia.

November 8, 2007
 Fixed the missing Konami code message. Try entering it at
 the title screen...

December 24, 2003
 I really, really, REALLY suck. GOD. I forgot one damn thing
 in the last patch - the ending! Apparently I worked over
 an older version of my work, and that did not include the ending I
 had inserted.

 Sooo, Dave DiGiorgio informed me of the problem on October 31.

 Yes, I know it's been two months. Shut up. Go play Patlabor or something.

October 11, 2003
 Not all was finished in this patch.

 Up Up Down Down Left Right Left Right B A Start.

 That is all.

January 5, 2003
 Well, I'll be damned.

 I'm done.

 Everything has been translated! Special thanks to King Mike for telling
 me about the ASM routine that was messing up the game when I hacked the
 title. I also found the hidden text, which wasn't really encrypted, it
 just used a -VERY- different encoding method. So, I spent all day
 finishing up the patch. And here's the result!

 There may be some bugs left; if so, please report them to the email
 address above. Thank you all! :D

October 31st, 2002
 Two years later I churn out this crappy patch for ya'll. This new version
 completely translates the bonus games, and all the text up to the fight
 with Garamos.

 Sadly, neither the ending nor the boss dialogue are done. Not enough
 time to do this. Yes, two years weren't enough. :P Seriously, it appears
 that the game uses... evil 6502 protection. So I can't hack the title
 screen nor the text used in Garamos' speeches.

 Eventually I'll get to that. But I decided to release this patch as thanks.

 Believe it or not.

August 1, 2000
 I found the pointer table! ^^ Time to get that translation going!
 
July 02, 2000
 Kalas, the creator of the original patch contacted me, asking why I did not use
 his original translation as a base for my own project. He has authorized that I
 use his patch as a basis to help me understand the game. So now, some more parts
 have been translated to english!

June 27, 2000
 I was wandering around The Whirlpool's "Dead NES Translations" section 
 and I found that a person named Kalas had already made a patch for the game.
 I had no idea that the game had been hacked previously, so credit will be given:
 The original project was created by Kalas, DarkMazda and Faraday.

 This patch does not contain anything from that original patch, mmkay? However, 
 I'll try to contact the original author to inform him of my decision.

June 17, 2000
 I got bored. Really bored. So I started to play some roms that I had
 obtained in one of my usual rom binges. I found this little jewel by 
 mistake; I thought that it was Castlevania 2 Japanese! That game is being
 translated by Gideon Zhi, so don't ask me about it.
 Anyway, it's a really nice game in my opinion, so I started messing with it.

  This is just a small bugfix regarding some font editing, there's nothing new.

 Version .15, July 03, 2000 [2724 bytes] *not released*
  I have translated the 'Game Start/Password' screen and the Password Screen.
  Nothing much, it seems... However, the game is now mostly cavespeaked!
  Oh, and if you beat the game, wait until after the credits, and the Konami logo,
  to find something from myself...

 Version .101, June 23, 2000 [1115 bytes], released June 28, 2000
  All of the original status bar editing has been replaced with a cleaner, nicer
  font. [Pokémon Trading Card Game's 3x7 uppercase font]

 Version .10, June 18, 2000 [1137 bytes]
  I've added all the remaining attack names, and the word 'STAGE' in the
  status bar.

 Version .005, June 17, 2000 [733 bytes] 
  *unreleased due to cancelled interview with Spinner 8*
  The only things I've messed with are the "Game Over" screen and the attack
  names. Don't worry, the game's text is intact. Nothing has been cavespeaked.



What's left
-----------------
  Nothing... or so it would seem.


Game Notes:
-----------------
  This is a game starring Kid Dracula. He appeared in a Game Boy game titled
  Kid Dracula [What an original name, neh? =P]. The game itself got huge 
  praises in Mexico's official Nintendo Magazine [Club Nintendo]. Hell, I even
  had a poster of it! But I never saw it here. I haven't even found the GB rom yet! 

  If you've played the Parodius or Wai Wai World series, you already know
  what to expect. In this game, Konami makes fun of the Castlevania series,
  by sending at you horrible enemies, like teenage witches, aliens, ducks in bath
  robes, skating girls, an SD version of the Grim Reaper, and "The Little
  Sister of Frankenstein's Monster". The first stage takes place in Count 
  Dracula's castle, so you may find some parts familiar.

  After you finish a stage, you get a new attack, and you can spend your coins
  in 4 mini games: A slot machine, a lottery, one involving three girls dancing
  Can-Can =D, and one that has something to do with a skeleton in a barrel?!

Emulator notes:
-----------------
  FCE Ultra runs the game... but it seems to have some problems with it, it lags
  sometimes when you run the game [even the unhacked version]. It still plays fine,
  but it takes a while to get used to it. Famtasia Version 5.1 runs the game fine
  as well. None of the Nester variants will run the hacked game. It may crash some
  of them, so be careful!

  And no, this doesn't work in Nesticle. Jeez.


Game Controls:
-----------------
  Left     - Makes your character move to the left.
  Right    - Makes your character move to the right.
  Up       - Makes you aim/shoot upwards [with the B button];
             Makes you climb up a ladder.
  Down     - Makes you crouch.;
             Makes you go down a ladder.
  Select   - Changes the attack.
  Start    - Pauses the game.
  A Button - Makes you jump. Depending on the time held, you jump higher/farther.
  B Button - Makes you shoot;
             If held, you can shoot one of two special attacks: If you let go of it
             before the face grins completely, you will shoot a big fireball, if you
             let go of it when the face grins completely, you will get the Power Attack;
             it is different depending on the attack.





A very special thanks to:
