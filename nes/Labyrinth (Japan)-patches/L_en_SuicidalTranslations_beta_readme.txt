This is an English translation patch for the NES/Famicom game Labyrinth. This patch is just a beta and should not be distributed anywhere other than by Suicidal Translations at http://www.pigtails.net/ST. If you play the beta an encounter any bugs or other errors, please let me know, preferably by providing a screenshot and/or a save state where you encountered the problem. Once I've cleaned up the script a bit and am confident that the patch is bug-free, I will release an official patch which can be distributed at will.
