Gameplay:
---------
The game is a platformer. The main objective is to get the key then exit thru a door (aside from the door from whence the player came out of, duh!).
But it isn't that simple, the player has to figure out how to get the key first before escaping to the next floor. The player has no weapons
so you must rely on evading enemies. Other than that, there's a time limit in every floor, so you should keep that in mind.
In some floors, you need items found in treasure boxes to pass. In some obstacles, you need to hit the wall or the ceiling just to duck.
