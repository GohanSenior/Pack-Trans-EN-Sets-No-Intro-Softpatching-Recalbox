Stuff Done
-----------------
More than likely, everything.
Fixed a couple of bugs in a few editors.

-----------------
Stuff Not Done
-----------------
Nothing, I hope.

Patching Instructions
-----------------
Go to your favorite emulation site and download SNESTool. Drop it, the
patch, and the Japanese Dezaemon ROM into the same directory. Then
open SNESTool. If it's missing some extenders, you'll have to find 'em
on your own. Once you get SNESTool running, select (Use IPS) then the
cosmogen.ips patch file, then the Japanese Dezaemon ROM. You should
now be patched.

-----------------
If you find a bug
-----------------
More than likely, it's untranslated text. Send a savestate or screenshot
(preferably the former, in NESticle format) to Gideon Zhi, and I'll try to
fix it.
