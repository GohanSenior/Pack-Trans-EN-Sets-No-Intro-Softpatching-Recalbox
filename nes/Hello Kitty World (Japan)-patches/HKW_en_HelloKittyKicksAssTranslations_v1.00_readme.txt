                        Hello Kitty World
                       English to Japanese
                           Translation
                             v. 1.00



-------------------------- DEDICATION ---------------------------

This translation is dedicated to Toma for all he's given to the
scene. His translations are fun, his personality has made the
romhacking scene a more enjoyable place to be and his attitude is
a perfect example of what romhacking/translating is all about. 
The world needs more people like Toma. Then again, the thought of
millions of Toma's running around is extremely frightening. Either
way, we thank you, Toma.

-------------------------- INTRODUCTION -------------------------

Hello Kitty is a one or two player side scrolling action game.
You play the part of Hello Kitty who must fly through 4 stages in
order to find and rescue her friend Tubby who got lost when he 
flew off over the horizon because of his big bunch of ballooons.
    The game was brought to America in the form of Balloon Kid for
the Gameboy. I believe that Hello Kitty World is superior to 
Balloon Kid for 2 reasons. First of all, it's an NES game (hence
it's in color) and secondly, well, Hello Kitty just kicks all ass.
     We chose to dedicate this translation to Toma for the simple
reason that he liked the game and once mentioned that he'd like to
see it translated. The game is pretty self explanatory and if you
have trouble, watch the demo at the beginning of the game for 
instructions. It patches just fine with either SNES Tool or IPS.

----------------------------- STAFF -----------------------------

 Hello Kitty Kicks Ass Translations was the name chosen for this
 unofficial team. We worked on this project together because of a
 mutual respect for Toma and the desire to express our thanks for
 his contributions to the translation/hack scene. We're not an
 official group so don't expect any future releases though various
 combinations of group members will undoubtably work together on 
 various projects.
      So, in alphabetical order, here are the people who's combined
 effort brought forth the translation you see today:

        Chojin - developed the japanese table for the script dump
     Darkforce - inserted the title screen and created new  CS logo
       InVerse - oversaw the entire project and did the text hacking
       Musashi - translated the Japanese script
       Naflign - initial hacking and font work
 Ordered Chaos - dumped the Japanese script
         sl1me - designed the new title screen
      Wildbill - edited the English script

 My thanks go out to everyone who participated in this project and
 anyone who had an indirect effect on the project via development of
 hacking techniques, utility programs and inspiration.

----------------------------- TOOLS -----------------------------

 The following tools were used for this translation:

  Hexposure: text translations
 Tile Layer: graphics hacking
     Thingy: script dumping
  SNES Tool: patch creation
  
---------------------- PATCHING INSTRUCTIONS --------------------

 Patching a ROM is extremely simple. You need three things. A ROM,
 the patch and a patching program. To patch with IPS, you simply
 type "ips <ROM name> <patch name>". So if the name of the ROM was
 HKW.nes you would type "ips HKW.nes hkwe.ips" and your ROM is now
 in English. Make sure you have all the files in the same directory
 if you have a problem.
      To patch a ROM with SNES Tool, simply select USE IPS, choose
 the patch and then choose the ROM to affix the patch to. It's self
 explanatory. If you can't figure it out, the game is probably too
 hard for you anywayz.

----------------------- CONTACT INFORMATION ---------------------

 There is no official Hello Kitty World site at this time but I
 believe there are plans in the works to create one soon. Once it
 is complete, http://come.to/HelloKittyWorld will take you there.

 E-Mail addresses concerning the project can be located on the 
 official page once it's completed or else you can e-mail me at
 HelloKittyWorld@hotmail.com.

----------------------------- CLOSING ---------------------------

 So there you have it. Have fun and remember. It's just a game.
