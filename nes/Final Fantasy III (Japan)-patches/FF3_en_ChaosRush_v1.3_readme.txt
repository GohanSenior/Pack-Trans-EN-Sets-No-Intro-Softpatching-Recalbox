Final Fantasy III 2019 Translation v1.3
by Chaos Rush

PATCHING INSTRUCTIONS:
Apply the included patch file to a clean, unmodified,
Japanese Final Fantasy III FAMICOM/NES ROM.

This is a translation patch of Final Fantasy III for the
Famicom/NES. It aims to be an accurate translation that
also uses Square Enix's terminology for its modern
remakes of that game. The script is influenced by the
DS remake, but the only information expressed by
characters is strictly limited to information that was
in the original Japanese script. It also aims to be the
definitive English version of Final Fantasy III in doing
so. This translation keeps the original ROM format of
the Japanese version of the game, thus this should work
on hardware as well as any emulator that supports the
Japanese version.
