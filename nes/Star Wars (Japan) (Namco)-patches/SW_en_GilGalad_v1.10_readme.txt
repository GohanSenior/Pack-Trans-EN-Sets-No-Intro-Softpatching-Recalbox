Game Details
---------------
Star Wars, the Namco version is a Famicom game released in Japan
only. This game is based on the movie Star Wars IV: A New Hope.
However, the story is quite a bit different in this game.

You control Luke in planet based missions, using force powers
along the way to get you to the end. At the end Luke will face
a boss that is at first Darth Vader and then transforms into
a native monster boss of the planet.

Once you leave a planet, you will face many battles against Tie-
Fighters on the way to the next planet. During this mission you
will get a call from another main cast character, usually to come
rescue him/her.

At the end, Luke will pilot a X-Wing in an attempt to destroy the
Death Star.

Update History
-----------------
Version 1.10 - A number of improvements have been made. The force menu
now uses single tiles instead of squishy tiles. The dialog has been touched
up and some of the emulation compatibility problems have been worked on,
to play mainly with Nestopia 1.37, perhaps in later versions of this
emulator. English translation credits were also added to title screen.

A big thanks goes out to Cahos Rahne Veloza for beta testing
and offering suggestions to improve the patch. 02-08-2009
