Minelvaton Saga: Ragon's Return
======================================================
One of my long-standing prjects. As a matter of fact,
that was the second game I wanted to work, but due to
my lack of knowledge back then (and considering the
fact that this game is hell in terms of hacking) I was
not able to finish it.
I've made a comeback, when Djinn and DvD helped with
deciphering the technical part of this nightmare and
I was finally able to work with the text itself.
The game is the first in the 3-piece gaming series,
which I called the "Silva Trilogy". Actually, this
is a prequel, but its relations with the followers
are rather loose.
The game starts very traditionally, when a longstanding
arch-rival Ragon cames back to the world of Minelvaton,
killing all representatives of Arkasas' royal dynasty
but a young prince...
This is a role you take here. The game is very difficult
and it has a very peculiar battle system. I won't spoil
anything more - for those willing - you can download
the translated manual and the world map for this game
from my blog.
The Version 1.03 has some bugs and misspellings gone.
The most notorious Hero's Shield bug is also fixed.
======================================================
SPECIAL NOTICE
======================================================
I'd very grateful, if you send me reports about bugs
or glitches found during gameplay, but please, do not
forget to add some descriptions, savestates and names
of emulators you use. (screenshots would be useful
as well).
PLEASE, IF YOU FIND THE ENEMIES THAT LOOK LIKE
THE "SKELETON" AND THE "SAND WORM" BUT HAVE NO NAMES
IN THE RELATED IN-GAME BATTLE BOX - DO LET ME KNOW
AS I WASN'T ABLE TO...

Due to changes made to the ROM, the patch is in IPS
format. You either want to download a program called
beat by byuu or Floating IPS, which can be found here:
