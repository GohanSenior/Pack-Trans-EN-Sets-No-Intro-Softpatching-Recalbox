This translation/localization was created with love and care by Polinym
 of the Woolsey Fan Company (W.F.C.). The original version was finished on 12 / 20 / 2019. 
This patch ( "Stardom Warriors (USA).ips" ) is to be applied to an ordinary, 
headered "LaSalle Ishii's Childs Quest" (often mistakenly referred to as 
"Rasaru Ishii no Child's Quest") ROM file. 

Please note that your original ROM file may have an incorrect header. 
You do not need to worry about this, as this IPS patch automatically applies 
the correct header for the game to work as intended. When this patch is used, 
the graphical errors are GUARANTEED to be fixed. If for some reason this is not the case,
 then contact Polinym as soon as possible.

I, Polinym, have rigourously tested this game over and over to ensure that no errors
 occur in gameplay. As of this release, there are no known issues what-so-ever. The only
 exception to this is a minor easter egg of the "hidden suits". A formating issue causes a 
few extra letters to be printed along with the item name / adjective. This, again, 
has no impact on gameplay. It is also possible that one or two lines have the "bleeding text" 
issue where a few letters of text print outside the window, but there are none that I can recall. 
If you spot one, let me know as soon as possible.

Also included with the USA Version patch is the "Manager's Handbook", an imitation
 of a Nintendo Player's Guide for this game. It gives you advice and tips on how to play the game.
 While not necessary, the guide will greatly help you to beat this.

I hope you enjoy Stardom Warriors, and that you check out other localizations 
by the Woolsey Fan Company. If you've got a game in mind that you'd like to see
 localized like an official 80's NES release, please let me know! If you have any feedback
 as to what you liked, didn't like, or want to know how/why the WFC made "its" 
localization decisions, also let me know. You can reach me on ROMHacking.net
