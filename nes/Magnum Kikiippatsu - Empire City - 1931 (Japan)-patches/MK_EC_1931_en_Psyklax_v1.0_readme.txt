INTRO
This patch replaces the title screen of Magnum Kiki Ippatsu
- Empire City - 1931 with the original arcade title, which
is simply Empire City - 1931. All other in-game text is
believed to be in English, so no other changes were
necessary.

ROM INFORMATION
GoodNES name: Magnum Kiki Ippatsu - Empire City - 1931 (J).nes
CRC32: BD736EC8

FINAL THOUGHTS
Another easy one for me. I could see that the only actual
Japanese in this game was on the title screen (a common
thing among Famicom games), so I copied the title from the
original arcade version of the game, pasted it into the ROM,
then tweaked the code to fit it there. There was plenty of
room in the graphics bank for it, although due to the border
that they chose to use on this port, I had to split the
title over two lines - not that it matters, of course.

I know the font looks quite simple, but I kind of like it.
It's so bold and in-your-face, and I'm pleased that it is a
1:1 copy of the arcade original. I'm actually surprised that
they didn't release it in the US, given the setting, and
that it's already in English anyway. Oh well, have fun!

Tools I used for this translation:
FCEUX (best NES emulator for debugging and hacking)
HxD (general hex editing)
Tile Molester (graphics)
GIMP (for cutting out the arcade game title)
