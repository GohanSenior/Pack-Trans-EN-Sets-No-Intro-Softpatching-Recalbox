-BlackPaladins's The Lord of King NES Patch-
--------------------------------------------

******************
*The Lord of King*
******************

I was curious about this game, so I looked into making a translation patch from this platformer.  For those who are unaware, this game was released in English as "Astyanax", which was also based on an arcade game of the same name.

Patching Instructions:

This patch comes in four flavors:

The Lord of King (English).ips (English Patch in IPS Format; apply to JPN ROM)
The Lord of King (English).bps (English Patch in BPS Format; apply to JPN ROM)

The Lord of King B (English).ips (English Patch in IPS Format; apply to USA ROM)
The Lord of King B (English).bps (English Patch in BPS Format; apply to USA ROM)

I suggest using Lunar IPS for patch.  Use either patch, according to your personal preference.

Be sure to use on a NES ROM (262,160 bytes) with a header and with a CRC Checksum of AF267213.  Where to find said ROM is up to you.  I cannot tell you where to look for it.
