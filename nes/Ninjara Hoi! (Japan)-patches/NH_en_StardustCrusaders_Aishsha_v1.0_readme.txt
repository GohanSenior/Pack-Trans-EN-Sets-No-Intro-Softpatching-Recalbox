Ninja Rahoi
======================================================
Background: This project was started by aishsha a long
time ago in circa 2009 and was slowly worked on over the
years. aishsha did all the initial translating and hacking,
which he might've gotten some help with from others currently
unknown. I did some bugfixing in 2011/12 and it wasn't until
2013 that the project began nearing completion.

Ninja Rahoi is a DQ clone that's a parody like Tengai
Makyou and it also happens to be made by the same
people who made Momotarou Densetsu. It seems this
time they set their sights on making fun of Japanese
pop culture of the time.

Naturally, this made translating the game much harder
than usual as the game featured a plethora a puns and
references based on historical figures and stuff from
pop culture. The decision was made to localize all this
while still trying to maintain a balance in keeping
the game Japanese. So, all pop culture references were
replaced with a Western equivalent and any jokes were
redone in English while trying to preserve the spirit/idea
as close as possible. There's really not a perfect way
to translate this type of game, but I really wanted the
uninformed player to see how funny this game is and I do
believe I accomplished that. But I didn't do it alone,
I had lots of help from a few translators. Ryusui helped
me a ton with this game, Eien ni Hen did the occasional
proofing and ideas for localization, and harmony7 helped
me with some of the more difficult/obscure stuff. 

So a bit about the game. It's a weird, wacky game
only the Japanese could've made. Aside from basic
DQ clone gameplay, the game features a Jutsu system
that levels up based on how many times you use a
Jutsu in battle. There also several special/joke
enemies in the game mixing up battle greatly.
The rest of the game is a blast.

Game Tips
=====================================================
*If you complete Stinkosai's initial quest and return
to him in exactly 1 hour, he will say something special.

*If you use your Ninjutsu in battles x number of times,
it will "level up." It goes from Hyper to Super to
Ultra to Miracle.
======================================================
Known Issues
======================================================

*If you decide to name the main character or dog less than
6 characters, it will still treat the names as if they
were 6 characters long. This is a flaw in the original
game and something I didn't feel like fixing.

*The Trippy Balls item can sometimes change the palette
so that the text isn't visible. Again, flaw in the original.

P.S.

Support the game industry by buying used games!

Even if the money doesn't go to the developers
directly, as the games become rare and harder
to find, the price goes up, and people become
more inclined to buy new releases "while they can!"
