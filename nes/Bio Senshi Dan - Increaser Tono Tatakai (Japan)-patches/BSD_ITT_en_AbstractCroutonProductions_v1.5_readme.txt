this file is a patch, not an actual playable game image. to use it, you need
the original japanese rom and an ips patching program.

this game is called "bio senshi dan: inkuriza to no tatakai" in japanese. an
official translated version exists as a prototype. the proto has been known to
exist for quite some time now, but no dump has been made. i like the game, so
i decided to translate it. it'll be interesting to see, if a dump is ever
made, how my translation compares to the official one. that translation is
titled "bashi bazook." i think that title sucks. so maybe the original one is
stupid too...

as there are at least three different versions of the rom out there, version
1.5 of this patch attempts to patch your copy to a working version. if it
won't function after you apply the patch, you are probably using a rom that
was hacked to use a different mapper (#34). this patch unfortunately won't
work with that rom. text has also been cleaned up very slightly.

things changed in translation:

* all japanese text translated into english (duh)

* title screen graphics changed. i like the idea of subtitled title screens,
  but no one else seems to.

* some small changes made to the various status displays, which were sloppily
  put together in the japanese version and look better now.

* the kanji in the wrestling game were NOT deleted. a screenshot from a
  magazine advertisement exists showing these kanji in the translated version
  of the game. besides, it's kind of impossible to translate the word in
  question, which is a martial arts term for "go" or "yes sir" or something.
  yeah, i'm concerned with minutiae...

enjoy!

tools used: a bunch, but most of them were crap so i don't feel like crediting
them. why is it there are no good hex editors for windows? why is it that i
can't run dos programs in xp? microsoft and crappy rom-hacking programming
authors can kiss my ass. no, seriously... at least the latter is doing what
they do for free, so i guess they don't have to kiss my ass. anyway, i've
found tile layer pro and repointerer to be pretty decent tools. i also used
the spoony bard font pack.
