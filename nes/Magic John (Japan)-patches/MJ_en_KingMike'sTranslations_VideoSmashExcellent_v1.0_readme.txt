INTROUCTION
***********
Around 2005, Shih Tzu wrote an article comparing Magic John to the official US release, Totally Rad.
This was called The Rad Project, and you should like... totally read it or something if you haven't.

So, with his permission, I just put his translation back into the Magic John ROM.

WHAT'S BUGGY
************
 None I'm aware.

PATCHING INSTRUCTIONS
*********************
 Either apply the IPS version of the patch to a Magic John ROM,
 or use a program such as upset (from byuu.org) to apply the UPS version.
 Do not apply the translation to a Totally Rad ROM. I haven't tried it, but I think the patch will just break it.

****************
EMULATION ISSUES
****************
 This game uses mapper 18. Most recent emulators should support it.

*****************
PLAY INSTRUCTIONS
*****************
 Simple instructions:
 D-Pad to move.
 A to jump.
 B to shoot.
 Hold B to charge.
 Push Start to pause and choose a magic spell.
