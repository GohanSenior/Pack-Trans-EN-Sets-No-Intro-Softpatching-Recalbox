Ninja Jajamaru: Galactic Battle
English Translation Patch - version 1.00 11/19/02
By HTI  http://hti.rpgclassics.com


What You'll Need:
-----------------
1. This patch you just downloaded
2. A Ninja Jajamaru: Ginga Dai Sakusen ROM for the NES/Famicom
3. SNESTool


What You'll Need To Do:
-----------------------
After you've downloaded the ROM, this patch, and SNESTool, put them all into
the same directory.  Backup the ROM if you wish, then run SNESTool, select
"Use IPS", then select "jaja100.ips", then your ROM.  The ROM is now patched,
so run it in your favorite emulator.


Boring Patch History:
---------------------
I wanted to find a nice, simple, yet fun game to ease my way into ROMhacking.
I found this game, and began working on it.  I went to J2E's Message Board, and
got Leo Lindgren to help me with the translation.  He got it all done, with the exception
of a couple phrases.  I also ran into a slight problem finding some text, so
I lost interest for a while.  I found that certain areas of the game needed a new
table, since the font was mapped to different values, so I pursued another
translator to finish the last couple of lines.  Finally, Cidolfas convinced me
to e-mail his friend Nora, which I did, and she was able to translate it.

Then I got the rest done fairly quickly, pieced together a title screen, and was
done.


Gameplay Notes:
---------------
There are a lot of large pits you'll have to jump across, and the two main
characters aren't particularly great jumpers unless they're running.  Press
and hold "B" to gain momentum, the release to dash, allowing you to jump farther.

If you keep holding "B", you'll start rolling.  This can be used to defeat
enemies.

To enter the targets that are found at the end of levels, hold "B", press Up,
and jump, to jump straight up in the air, then hold "Up" to enter the target.
