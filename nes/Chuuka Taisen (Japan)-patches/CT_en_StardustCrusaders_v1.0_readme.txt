Background: Now for those familiar with the translation
scene, they might wonder why the hell I'm even doing this
translation in the first place when there's already one
that was done about a decade ago. Well, the short answer
is that that translation sucks and among other things has
numerous translation errors. One of the more hilarious
things I found out doing this translation was that it
uses a now banned "rude" word for Chinese people. Again,
the old translation missed the meaning of the word.
There was also a hidden ending that you could get that
wasn't done. I'm not here to bash the old translation,
but honestly there was a lot of room for improvement.

Initially all I had done was hack the game and dumped
the script, which sat around my computer for a few months.
Then out of the blue my longtime translator and friend
aishsha had asked me if I had any scripts for him to
translate, and well I had this. After all the script
work was done, it was time to tackle the various
graphics that needed to be hacked. Those were easy to
hack, but all of the graphic design minus the title
screen goes to DvD. Once again, his work was top notch.

Anyway, the game's a shooter and a hard one at that.
Can't really play it without cheats. The game was
originally released for the Arcade and then ported
to god knows how many systems including the wonderful
Famicom.

Game Tips
======================================================

* At the title screen, hold Up-Left + B and press Start.
If done right, you should hear a sound. Now, press Select,
B and Left to enter the hidden option menu.
If you turn the "Power Select" on, then while playing,
you can pause the game and press B to increase the power
of your shots.

* You can access a secret stage on stage 4. I won't
give you all the details, but look for a flashing
red dragon.

* You can get a secret ending by beating the game without dying.

Translation Notes
======================================================

This game uses a banned word that originated from the early
20th century when Japan was invading China. The word is
"Pokopen" which is a rude way to refer to a Chinese person.
I chose to translate this as chink and have made no attempts
to hide or censor it. Aside from that, the game features
many things that some consider politically incorrect or
offensive.

After each stage you get a "Xian" rank. Xian is the Chinese
version of Sennin. Both pretty much mean "Great Immortal Being"
etc. Essentially all the various ranks are Buddhist gods
or some other derivitive. All this information might
not be very informative or accurate, because I know
almost jack squat about this stuff.

======================================================
Patching Instructions
======================================================
Apply the patch to a copy of the original Japanese ROM.
It should be named something like this:
Chuuka Taisen (J).nes

We would be highly grateful, if you find some time to 
contact us with proposals or corrections. Information
on found bugs or corrections would be highly 
appreciated.   

P.S.

Support the game industry by buying used games!

Even if the money doesn't go to the developers
directly, as the games become rare and harder
to find, the price goes up, and people become
more inclined to buy new releases "while they can!"
