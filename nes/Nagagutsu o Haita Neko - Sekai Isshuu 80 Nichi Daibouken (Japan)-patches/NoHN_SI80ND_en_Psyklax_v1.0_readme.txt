INTRO
This is a 100% English translation of Nagagutsu wo Haita
Neko - Sekai Isshuu 80 Nichi Daibouken for the Famicom
(NES). The only Japanese text present in the game is the
title screen and a kanji in-game that represents 'day'. Both
of these were translated (the new title is Puss In Boots -
Around The World In 80 Days), and some English spelling
errors in the game were also corrected.

FINAL THOUGHTS
There's really not much to say about this: unlike most of my
translations, the title screen was a large of the work, and
I drew it myself. It's not the best, I know, but it could be
worse. I'm not 100% happy with the spacing, but I had to
crowd the elements closer together because I couldn't fit
any more in the code inside the ROM without some extra work,
so I took the easy way out.

One thing that I thought would be simpler at first glance
was the one other bit of Japanese in the game: it uses the
kanji for 'day' next to the day counter. I figured I wanted
to have 'days' instead of this one character, but to do this
I had to write a whole routine in ASM to check if the 'day'
tile comes up and write ' days' (with the space) instead. I
was pleased to see my efforts were rewarded. I had to move
the timer across the screen a touch - don't want to enter
the dreaded Overscan Zone - but there's so much space at the
top that it's no problem.

Finally, the names of places had some typos, which I fixed.
I can understand 'Paciphic Ocean', but 'Alask'? Anyway,
that's all done now.

So, this was a very quick project indeed, but I hope you
have fun. It's a pretty brutal game, though.

Tools I used for this translation:
FCEUX (best NES emulator for debugging and hacking)
HxD (general hex editing)
WindHex32 EX (checking text)
Tile Molester (graphics)
GIMP (designing the title screen)
