Toma's Dumb Little Story About The Transaltion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This game is cool. You're a neat little bald
guy with a third eye who kills cute little
puppy dogs and huge, translucent, tentacled
plant monsters. Nifty, huh?!

I didn't make this game, Tomy did.  I don't want
the thing distributed with the ROM cuz that's just
bad and I'd never do it so you shouldn't cuz it's
illegal and all that crap.
Umm... how's that?
