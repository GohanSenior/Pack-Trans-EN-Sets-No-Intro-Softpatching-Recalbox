Background: For both myself and aishsha this was practically
our first translation personally and working together.
Originally I had released a slightly incomplete patch
on Xmas 2008 and there were still issues that weren't
dealt with until 2 years later. It took way longer than
it should have, but it's now done and that's all that matters.



I would like to mention that I find this game to be on
the very bad side. If anyone is crazy/dumb enough to
play it, I will try to give them some guidance as to
what to do. First of all, you do not level up automatically.
You must go to a guild to get a level up. Finally, the
goal of the game is to gather an army and conquer all
castles in the world. I would also recommend a heavy
usage of cheating to speed the game up.

A few bugs and odd stuff to note. The menu occasionally
flashes brown. Pretty sure this was present in the
original version. Also attack and defense stats are
not effected by weapon and armor. This was probably
an oversight and I had originally altered the stat
routines to add when a new piece of equipment
was bought, but I removed it. I wasn't sure if
I was adding actual equipment stats.


Use a patching IPS utility of your choice to apply the
patch (I do recommend Lunar IPS). 

We would be highly grateful, if you find some time to 
contact us with proposals or corrections. Information
on found bugs or corrections would be highly 
appreciated.   

Enjoy the playing and do buy the game, if you like it!
