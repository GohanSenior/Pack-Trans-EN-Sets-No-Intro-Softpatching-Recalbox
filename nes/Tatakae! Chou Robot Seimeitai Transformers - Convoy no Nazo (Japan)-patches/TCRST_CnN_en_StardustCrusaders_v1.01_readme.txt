---------------------------
This game is possibly the worst game of the NES era. It's just god awful, but I've translated it for you so you can enjoy it in english. It was supposedly translated before, but the endings were never translated. So I took care of that and got a new title screen as well. I did some ASM hacks for the Mystery of Comvoy graphic as well. I must also point out that I only got 1 of the 3 endings possible and one of them could be a little wacky, but hopefully not.
