INTRO
This patch translates the tile of Ikinari Musician, renaming
it Spontaneous Musician. The word "ikinari" can be
translated as "suddenly, abruptly, spontaneously". The
latter was chosen as the most appropriate name.

ROM INFORMATION
GoodNES name: Ikinari Musician (J) [!].nes
CRC32: B5E2CB2F

FINAL THOUGHTS
There really isn't much to say about this at all. I'd just
come off another game that was a pain to hack with little
reward, so this was very welcome: the only thing to change
was the title, sitting in the graphics bank, ready to
change. Inside the ROM, the name table for the title screen
was just there, in the open. I even easily moved the star
(used in the original to mark a 'ji' in a stylish manner) a
few pixels so that it could dot an 'i'. The whole thing
probably took about an hour from start to finish.

The only other thing I changed was the name of the tune
clearly inspired by Pachelbel's Canon - it has a 'K' in the
original version. It's not really a verbal game - in fact,
it's not really a game at all. It's more a fun way of
playing about with music on the NES's sound chip. Maybe you
didn't know about this curious little item before - well,
now you do. Happy composing!

Tools I used for this translation:
FCEUX (best NES emulator for debugging and hacking)
HxD (general hex editing)
Tile Molester (graphics)
