Final Fantasy Translation v1.3
by Chaos Rush

PATCHING INSTRUCTIONS:
Apply the included patch file to a clean, unmodified,
Japanese Final Fantasy FAMICOM ROM, Rev B.

This is a translation patch of Final Fantasy for the
Famicom/NES. It aims to be an accurate translation
that also uses Square Enix's terminology for its
modern remakes of that game. The entire script from
the original Famicom version of the game was
retranslated.

There are two versions:

1. Default Edition
This is the default version. It strictly adheres to
the terminology used in the GBA/PSP/iOS remakes of
Final Fantasy. If you're a long-term fan that wants
to see stuff like Garland's famous line from the
original NES version retained, then this is the
version for you.

2. Chaos Edition
This is an alternate version that uses different
terminology for some names, particularly the
"Four Fiends" being changed to the "Chaos Four",
in order to be closer to the Japanese text to
preserve the four bosses' connection to the
final boss. In addition to that, all monsters
based off of D&D are spelled as they are in D&D.
This version does NOT rename anything else,
and therefore it should still maintain continuity
with the rest of the Final Fantasy series.
