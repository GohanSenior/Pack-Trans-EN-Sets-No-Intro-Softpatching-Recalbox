 -All done! I left the title cuz it's 1337!

My Dumb Little Story
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I started the translation before I ever knew the game
had already been translated as Panic Restaurant. I had
already finished the game except for the Fish/Meat thing
that I posted on CTC a while ago. After finishing the
thing, Dando informed me that it had already been
translated as Panic Restaurant. I was kinda disappointed,
but I figured I'd just leave it. I downloaded Panic
Restaurant and was kinda disappointed though. The title
was nowhere near as nice looking, the translation stank
(Hors d'Oeuv was changed into Ohdove even though in the
original it said in English letter Hors d'Oeuv... I dunno)
and (worst of all) they changed the psycho little chef
kid into a fat old man! They got rid of most of the psycho
expressions and everything! They also shortened the ending,
leaving out the funky scenes at the credits. So anyway,
since I already had the thing translated I figured I
might as well release it and see what people think. Yeah.

I didn't make this game, Disco/Taito did.  I don't
want the thing distributed with the ROM cuz that's
just bad and I'd never do it so you shouldn't cuz
it's illegal and all that crap.
Umm... how's that?
