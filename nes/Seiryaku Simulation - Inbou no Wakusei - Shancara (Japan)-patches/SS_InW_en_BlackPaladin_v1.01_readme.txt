*************************************************
*Seiryaku Simulation - Inbou no Wakusei Shancara*
*************************************************

"Inbou no Wakusei: Shancara" is a game released by IGS Corporation.  The best way this game can be described is if the board games Dune and Junta had a love affair, and Shancara was their lovechild.

Shancara is a remote planet in the galaxy that recently had its independence recognized by the Galactic Empire.  However, the planet must elect a president to represent Shancara and have its independence recognized.  You play one of four characters who are vying for power, and you must win by ANY MEANS NECESSARY.

You can plays as one of the following characters...

Moto (Original name: Minamoto):  Moto is a war hero whose had a large amount of his body replaced with mechanical parts and is now a cyborg.  He has a powerful personal army at his disposal and is supported by the Technics.
Bora (Original name: Borgia):  Bora is the owner of the spaceport and can control the trading of ore whenever she sees fit.  Whenever someone exchanges ore for credits, Bora receives a cut from the transaction.  She is supported by the Trust.
Garo (Original name: Garoa):  Garo is a nobleman, descended from the first human settlers of Shancara.  He holds a large amount of influence with many of Shancara's factions.  He is supported by the Ozoriens.
Alib (Original name: Alibabu):  Alib is the king of Shancara's native population.  He owns more mines compared to the other characters, thus, can gather more ore per month than other characters.  He is supported by the Kameroids.

The game also has twelve factions players can align themselves to.

Ozoriens:  This is the largest of the factions who represent the human race on Shancara.  Garo has the largest sway with this faction at the beginning of the game.
Zen Cult (Original Name: Zen Order) This faction composes of believers of their god, Zen, who aim to unite the galaxy under their religion.  Support from this faction grants the use of Monks during war mode.
Garimpei (Original Name: Garimpeiro): This faction represents the miners on Shancara.  Support with this faction grants the use of Galim (Original Name: Galimpei) during war mode.
Kameroid:  This faction represents the native population of Shancara. Alib has the largest way with this faction at the beginning of the game.  Support with this faction grants the ability to command the Kroids (Original Name: Kameroids) during war mode.
Trust:  This faction represents the workers at the spaceport.  Bora has the largest sway with this faction at the beginning of the game.  Support with this faction grants the Cybot during war mode.
Technics (Original Name: Technocrats): This faction is devoted to the development of weapons and technology.  Support with this faction will grant the use of Tarkas (and Amoeba after a special news event) during war mode.  Moto has the largest sway with this faction.
Empire (Original Name: Galactic Empire):  This faction is devoted to having Shancara returning to the Galactic Empire's control.
Freemen (Original Name: Independence Party):  This faction is devoted to severing all ties with the Galactic Empire and full autonomy on Shancara.
Chimaera:  This faction represents mutants who are the fusion of humans and Shancara natives.  They're a peace-loving species who desire coexistence between both the human race and the natives of Shancara.
Albarani (Original Name: Aldebaran):  This faction represents the alien race who resemble lobsters who've settled on Shancara.
Terrors (Original Name: Terror Faction):  This faction represents a band of assassins and mercenaries.
