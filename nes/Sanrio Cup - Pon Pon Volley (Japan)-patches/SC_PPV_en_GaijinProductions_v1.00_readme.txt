About the Game
--------------
In this volleyball/four square type game you can play as one of 4 Sanrio characters.  Those fun guys are: Hello Kitty, Kerropi, Tabo, and Pochacco.  The game has a 1 on 1 singles mode, doubles play, and 1 on 3 four squares mode.  


About the Project
-----------------
I started this project sometime in the Fall of 1998.  I was making good progress and having fun until I came across translating the graphic signposts and scroeboards between games.  Because of these I dropped the project until Winter.  On this second attempt to finish it dumped the script (I think all of it) and translated what I could.  But several factors lead to my frustration and disgust on working on this english patch any further.  I finished what I could and released what was done.  Well along comes good ol' Spinner 8 and saves the project.
Thanks to him all the graphic signposts and scoreboards are now done.

Thanks
