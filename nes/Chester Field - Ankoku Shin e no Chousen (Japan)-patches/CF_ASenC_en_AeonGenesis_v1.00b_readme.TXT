1.About Chester Field
---------------------
Chester Field's a sidescrolling action/RPG kind-of along the lines
of Zelda 2 and Faxanadu. It's split into eight levels, each of which
has a maze in it, and within each maze is a treasure which does
something, or something. It has no relation to the cigarettes.

2.Patch History
---------------
Script got dumped some long time ago, and Akimaru spent most of that
long time translating it. About three months ago, he finished it and
I inserted it. Then I let the thing rot for about three months because
LAL made me sick of updating my site, or something.

March 7, 2002 - Initial version 1.00b Release
