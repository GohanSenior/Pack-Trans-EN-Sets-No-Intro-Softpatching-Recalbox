                             Introduction

SD Splatterhouse may well be the coolest side-scroller game ever. Of
course you might not think that if you had to play through it over and
over again to test out stuff. But hey, it's good for a quick diversion.
You're a guy who came back from the dead, and you've got a hockey mask,
and your girlfriend got kidnapped by some demon. As you can tell it's an
amazing plot that will quickly draw you in, but basically you swing an axe
around and kill various things, and you get a shotgun in some places,
which packs quite the punch. And yes, it recoils. How's THAT for realism?
Kids these days.. No one bitched about an Italian plumber eating
mushrooms and doubling in height.. Now anything that isn't 3D sucks! Bah!

This translation can now be officially called "complete." Before, only the
ending was translated. Now, everything is 100% english, including a killer
title screen by Ballz. I don't think I'll mess with this again, since
there's really nothing left to do.. But don't hesitate to email me if I've
missed anything.

Patch history!
--------------
Version 2.00 - New title screen, some stuff I missed.. completely 100%
               now!
Version 1.00 - Everything should be done! I might fix the title screen,
               but other than that it's great.

                               End-User

Not much you need to know here... This game will run just fine on any
emulator that claims to support Mapper 19. Actually, there isn't one
that fully supports it, but Famtasia comes closest. Anyway enough of my
bitching about Megami Tensei 2. Ahem.

Patching is simple.. You can use the easy way with SNES-Tool, or you can
be a man like me and use IPS.EXE. Get the unpatched rom and the ips file,
and then at the DOS command prompt type:

IPS SPLATTER.NES SPLATTR2.IPS

In case you're a complete idiot, you should substitute SPLATTER.NES for
whatever the name of your rom is. Just be aware that IPS.EXE doesn't
support long filenames. Anyway, now you're all set to play. Hopefully
something as easy as this needs no explanation. BioNES makes a
SPLATTER.NMC file when you run it, but I'll be damned if I know what it
does, since the game uses passwords.

                               Thanks!

Big thanks to Xeur, who took the time out of his study schedule to
   translate this stuff! And look, I actually finished it!

Thanks to Sardius. This translation is entirely dedicated to him and his
   niftiness. I forgot to mention that in the last readme. Sorry.
   
Thanks to Ballz, who made the title screen, and even inserted it himself!
   And hey, it even looks good!

Huge huge thanks to Sardu for coding NESticle! I never would have found
  the text in the rom if it weren't for that lubly F2 key.

Thanks to Amber, for hosting my sites!! Er, I mean site.

Thanks to Snowbro for making Tile Layer, which was a real life-saver in
   this case.

Of course, thanks to Skrybe who fixed this rom for all to enjoy. There,
  how's that?

And thanks to everyone else I forgot. I doubt I forgot anyone though.

                         Legal Made-Up Stuff

What are you doing with the SD Splatterhouse rom if you don't own the
cart?! Shame on you! Don't you know that Nintendo of America is going to
hunt you down and get a search warrant to be able to legally search your
computer for copies of games that were never released outside of Japan and
which can't be legally sold to anyone since the sale of used games is
prohibited and Famicom games went out of production years ago? And even if
you DO own the cart, and (naturally) dumped the rom yourself, don't even
THINK about applying this IPS patch to it, since that's a violation of
copyright. Why the hell did you download this thing anyway? I'm afraid I'm
going to have to take you downtown sir. Yes, that's right! I'm actually an
IDSA operative, and I've planted a beacon in this zip file! Whenever you
open this zip, the beacon will send me your name, address, telephone
number, PIN number, and all that pr0n you have! Oh, you do have a lot of
it, don't you? Oh my god, some of that stuff is really sick! Do people
actually DO that kind of stuff? I'm afraid I'll have to, um, examine this
evidence a little bit longer. Just, umm, keep downloading pr0n and open
this zip every so often. I'll get around to arresting you eventually.
