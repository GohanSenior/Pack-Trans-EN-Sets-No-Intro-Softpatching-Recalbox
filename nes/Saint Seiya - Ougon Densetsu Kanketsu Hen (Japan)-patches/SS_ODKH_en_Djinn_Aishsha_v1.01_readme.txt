Saint Seiya: Ougon Densetsu Kanketsu Hen
======================================================
Saint Seiya franchise is probably one of the most well
known (and long-playing) both in Japan and in the West,
containing several manga tomes, animations and games.
This one is the end of the so called "Gold Cloths
Period" in Seiya's timeline and as I can guess - this
is also continuation of the obscure RPG game released
on NES a bit earlier.

This time, it's a mix between a platforming action
and RPG (as strange as it may sound). 

It was a collaborative attempt when all the hacking
work and some misc translation was done by Djinn
(including huffman encoding, which allowed using a
lot more space for our translated text), while I was
responsible for major translation activities.

Use a patching IPS utility of your choice to apply the
patch (I do recommend Lunar IPS). 

We would be highly grateful, if you find some time to 
contact us with proposals or corrections. Information
on found bugs or corrections would be highly 
appreciated.   

Enjoy the playing and do buy the game, if you like it!
