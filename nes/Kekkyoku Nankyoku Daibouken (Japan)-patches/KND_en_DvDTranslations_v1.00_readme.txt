                    Antarctic Adventure


                        for the NES

                        published by

                           Konami

               Patch Version: 1.0

                Release Date: February 3, 2005

------------------------------------------------------------
Hello and welcome to the ReadMe file for

"Antarctic Adventure"

Although the in-game title for the game is "Antarctic
Adventure", written in English, the full title of the game
on the box is written in Japanese.  It literally translates
to "Eventually Antarctic Big Adventure."  Our only guess is
that the Japanese word for "Eventually" was really put there
to rhyme with the Japanese word for "Antarctic" so, in that
light, we could call it:

"Avalanche-ly Antarctic Adventure"

But, as it doesn't sound that good, we suggest sticking
with the in-game English name.

In this file I've included info on how to use the patch
and how to play.

A little history of Konami and the NES

Original game ROM size: 1 16k program ROM bank
                          &
                        1  8k character ROM bank
                      = 24 kBytes
                      = 24576 Bytes

Games designed for the original Famicom/NES hardware could
be 1 or 2 16k program banks and 1 8k character bank.  Later,
all games made for the NES used special mapper chips to
expand the size of the addressable ROM beyond these
limitations.  As this game only uses 1 program bank, it is
the smallest (and cheapest to manufacture) a game for the
NES could be!

Konami was the first 3rd party company that Nintendo
licensed to manufacture their own games for the Famicom.
Antarctic Adventure was Konami's first release for the
Famicom along with Yie Ar Kung-Fu!  I believe the latter
was their first game released for any home system,
specifically the Microsoft MSX.

List of Konami's Original 24k ROM Famicom Releases

 4-22-85 Yie Ar Kung-Fu                  MSX 1982 
 4-22-85 Kekkyoku Nankyoku Daibouken /
         Antarctic Adventure             MSX 1984 
 7-11-85 Road Fighter
 9-20-85 Pooyan         (w/ Hudson Soft)
 3- 4-86 Circus Charlie (w/ Soft Pro)
------------------------------------------------------------
How to patch the ROM file:

You need:

1) A ROM file.  The file must include the standard 16
   byte iNES header followed by the program ROM.  This
   makes the ROM file 24592 Bytes in size.

   I'm not telling you how to get the ROM file, but
   for this game, the format of the 16 byte iNES header
   should be:

   4E 45 53 1A 01 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

2) Patch File: AA_v1_00.IPS

3) An IPS patching program
   Recommended patching program for IBM PC:

    Snes-Tool.exe by The M.C.A./Elite

Using SNES Tool:

1) Make a copy of the un-patched ROM.  You always want to
   keep the un-patched ROM around for later revisions of
   the patch.
2) Place an un-patched ROM file with header
   (I'll call it AA.nes), AA_v1_00.IPS, and
   Snes-Tool.exe in the same directory.
3) Run Snes-Tool.exe
4) Type 'U' for "Use IPS"
5) Press the down arrow key until AA_v1_00.IPS
   is highlighted.
6) Hit Enter.
7) Press the down arrow key until AA.NES is highlighted.
8) Hit Enter.
9) Hit 'Q' to quit.

Note: If patching the file on a Mac, I recommend UIPS.
------------------------------------------------------------
Playing the game on an emulator:

For the PC, I recommend FCE Ultra, although being such a
basic ROM with no mapper and no fancy timing code, I'm sure
it works in every NES emulator ever made.
------------------------------------------------------------
Why I chose to translate THIS game:

1) I wanted to take a brake from determining the exact
   context of the nearly 500 blocks of text in Port Pier.
   I've made great progress, but staring at a text editor
   for months wasn't good on the eyes.

2) I've played and passed all the prequels to this game.
   It doesn't have any.  I have this thing about playing
   games that are part of a series in the order in which
   they came out...

3) I've played and passed many of the SEQUELS to this game.
   * "Yume Penguin Monogatari", for the NES, is essentially
     the closest thing to a true sequel to this game.
   * Penta the Penguin also shows up as a playable character
     in all of the games in the Parodius series.  Also
     many other penguins are cannon fodder in the game.
   * Konami's Krazy Racers (Wai Wai Racing) has an entire
     level devoted to Antarctic Adventure, the theme song
     plays and you drive over ice and avoid penguins.
   * I'm sure Penguin's show up at some time in the Wai Wai
     World series of games.

4) It's one of my family's favorite games on our 63in1 cart.

Why YOU should bother playing THIS game:

1) To understand where Konami's fascination with penguins
   came from!

It's a pretty simple game... but what do you expect for 24k?

                     :Climb out of fissure
  - while wearing
    helicopter hat
    and jumping      :Fly

3) The basic goal is to make it to the South Pole and back,
   stopping at different country's outposts along the way.
   You have a certain time to reach each outpost.  Along
   the way you can collect flags and fish for points.
   Avoid holes, seals, and falling into fissures.  A
   flashing flag not only gives you points but also gives
   you a helicopter hat that allows you to fly for a short
   distance over holes (but not seals).
