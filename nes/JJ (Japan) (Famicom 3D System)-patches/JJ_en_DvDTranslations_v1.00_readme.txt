               Patch Version: 1.00

                Release Date: November 13th, 2003

------------------------------------------------------------
Hello and welcome to the ReadMe file for "JJ Jump Out! The
Epic War - Part II" aka "JJ - The 3-D Battles of WorldRunner
- Part II".

In this file I've included info on how to use either of
these patches and how play control differs in this game from
that of "The 3-D Battles of WorldRunner".

How to Patch the ROM file:

Original Game ROM Size: 1 megabit of program ROM
                          &
                        0 megabits of character ROM
                      = 1 megabit
                      = 128 kBytes
                      = 131072 Bytes
You need:

1) A ROM file.  The file must include the standard 16 byte
   iNES header followed by the program ROM.  This makes the
   ROM file 131088 Bytes in size.

   I'm not telling you how to get the ROM file, but
   for this game, the format of the 16 byte iNES header
   should be:

   4E 45 53 1A 08 00 21 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

   Note: There are two versions of the ROM on the net.
         Both of them already have the correct header file
         and either these patches will work with either of
         them.

2) Patch Files: TD2v1_00.IPS - Translated Japanese title
                3D2v1_00.IPS - U.S. sequel title

   Choose only one of the above two files.

3) An IPS patching program
   Recommended patching program for IBM PC:

    Snes-Tool.exe by The M.C.A./Elite

Using SNES Tool:

1) Make a copy of the un-patched ROM.  You always want to
   keep the un-patched ROM around for later revisions of
   the patch.
2) Place an un-patched ROM file with header (I'll call it
   JJ.nes), TD2v1_00.IPS (or 3D2v1_00.IPS), and
   Snes-Tool.exe in the same directory.
3) Run Snes-Tool.exe
4) Type 'U' for "Use IPS"
5) Press the down arrow key until TD2V1_00.IPS
   (or 3D2V1_00.IPS) is highlighted.
6) Hit Enter.
7) Press the down arrow key until JJ.NES is highlighted.
8) Hit Enter.
9) Hit 'Q' to quit.

Note: If patching the file on a Mac, I recommend UIPS.

------------------------------------------------------------
Why I chose to translate THIS game:

1) After translating AD&D DragonLance 2 - Dragons of Flame,
   I wanted to do some simple NES translation work that
   focused more on graphics editing than it did on code
   changes.  You can't do a translation with any less coding
   than this!

2) The prequel was one of the first games I ever owned for
   the NES.  When I found it had a sequel, I was excited to
   see what it was like and why it hadn't been released in
   the US.  When I hit the select button and realized that,
   unlike the prequel, it required special electromechanical
   glasses to show the 3-D effect, I knew why it wasn't
   released here.

3) I've played and passed all the prequels to this game.
   It just has the one and this is the only sequel.  I have
   this thing about playing games that are part of a series
   in the order in which they came out...

4) I liked the game and had been playing it for a while,
   but I wished I knew what the title of the game meant.

Why YOU should bother playing THIS game:

1) It's a continuation of the game released in the US.
   Continue where you left off!

2) It's by Square.

3) See how the game differs from the prequel.
   Main difference: Because you can't control your speed,
                    it's more challenging.

------------------------------------------------------------
Game Controls & Tips:

1) If you haven't played The 3-D Battles of WorldRunner
   aka 3-D WorldRunner, you should read it's manual.  The
   controls and game play are EXACTLY the same as the
   prequel; that's why Square titled this game "Part II".

   With a little research you should be able to find a copy
   of the 3-D WorldRunner manual on the internet.  I own
   a copy of 3-D WorldRunner with manual, 3-D glasses, and
   box.  Still, before writing this I checked and I was able
   to find a scanned manual, in PDF form, for the NES
   version of 3-D WorldRunner on the net.  I also found a
   "text manual" for the game, but it was a poor,
   incomplete, paraphrase of the actual manual.  I guess
   it would be better than nothing.


2) Controls

* Start    : Start the Game
             Pause the Game - watch JJ smoke a cigarette :)

* Select   : Toggle normal & 3-D Mode

             Note: Whereas the 3-D mode in 3-D WorldRunner
                   only required red/blue 3-D glasses, the
                   3-D mode in this game requires special
                   3-D glasses whose left and right lenses
                   switch on and off for every scan of the
                   TV to give a perfect 3-D effect. These
                   glasses were released in the US for
                   the Sega Master System.  They have a
                   standard stereo headphones plug.
                   Schematics for an adapter for this plug
                   to allow it to plug into the PC serial
                   port can be found in the documentation of
                   the MEKA SMS emulator. But, I am unaware
                   of any NES emulators that can be used
                   with a pair of these glasses plugged into
                   your PC's serial port.

 -- Non-Boss Fights --

* A-button : Jump.  The longer you hold the button, the
             longer you will jump.

             Hint: After dying, hold down the A button
                   while hitting Start to continue at the
                   beginning of the world JJ last died on!
                   There are no limits to the number of
                   continues!  Yeah!

* B-button : Fire your gun (if you have one)

* Directional Pad

   - L & R : Move JJ left & right

   - U & D : Unused (Unlike 3-D WorldRunner, you can't
                     change JJ's speed, this makes it much
                     more challenging)
 -- Boss Fights --

* A-button : Unused

* B-button : Fire your gun
             (you'll always have one when fighting bosses)

* Directional Pad

   - U, D, 
     L & R : Move JJ up, down, left, & right
     

3) Crash into the white columns for power-ups:

 - Gun              -   | 
                        |
                      |/|\|

   Same as rocket shaped "Laser Missiles" in 3DWW


 - Shield           -  | |
                       | |
                      /   \

   Same as orange "Power Potion" in 3DWW


 - Death            -  ___
   (An eyeball)       /   \
                     |  O  |
                      \___/

   Same "Magic Mushroom" in 3DWW


 - Invincibility    -   o
                      /-+-\
                      \ | /
                       _+_
                       | |
                      _| |_

   Same as "Atomic Power" in 3DWW 

 - Extra JJ         -   O
   (Man's upper body)  / \ 
                       |_|

   Same as "Have a Heart" in 3DWW 

 - Extra Time       - "Cosmic Clock"
   
   Identical item in 3DWW

   Note: It is also possible to jump on top of the white
         columns after bouncing off of them.


4) Collect Energy Tanks for points

   /     \
  |   O   |
   \     /

   Same as "Super Stars" in 3DWW


5) Step on jumpers to cause JJ to do a super jump:

 - Springs on the ground           -  _____
                                      \___/
                                       ---
                                       ---
                                       ---
                                      /___\

   Same as green frog "Junior Jumper" in 3DWW

 - Flattened springs on the ground -  /===\

   Same as white flower "Super Jumper" in 3DWW


6) Catch rocket packs to fly to parallel worlds

    /| |\
   |-| |-|
   | |O| |
   |_| |_|

   Same as white "Warp Balloon" in 3DWW


7) Running into cell clusters do not hurt JJ but
   stop him from advancing.  Of course this is a major
   problem if JJ happens to be over a pit...

   Same as "Hand Man" in 3DWW


8) Jump over all pits.
   Shoot or jump over everything that moves.
   Don't touch red "Towering Infernos" or anything that moves.
   

9) There are 8 worlds composed of 2 to 4 quadrants each.
   All the bosses are easy except for World 7.  The boss in
   world 8 is invisible, but he is easily hit and made
   visible by shooting above his shadow.  World 8-1 is
   HUGE.  The only way to pass it without running out of
   time is to ONLY hit the pole that gives you a Cosmic
   Clock (2 of the 4 poles in the 5th row of poles) and not
   hit any other poles for power-ups.

         is running.

2) 1987: "The 3-D Battles of WorldRunner"

   has been changed to English.

3) 1987: "JJ Tobidase Daisakusen Part II"

   All of the ending text is already in English,
   but some of it is written using the Japanese hiragana
   alphabet.

   Tobidase Daisakusen Part II, the title bar of the game
   says "S Q U A R E PRESENTS JUMP'N JACK" when the demo is
