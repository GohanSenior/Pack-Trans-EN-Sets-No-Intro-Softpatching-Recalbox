kero kero keroppi's great big adventure 2 - by toma
        
THIS GAME IS EVEN MORE RULEY THAN BEFORE!

version 1.0

 - this has been wayyyy too long coming, but it's
   finally done. anyway, just to make up for slacking
   off I basically revamped the whole thing. spiffy
   new font, spiffy new title, and this time it's
   all done. enjoy!

version 0.9

 - i have the thing pretty much done. the only parts
   still untranslated are the battles with the 4
   bosses. reason? I couldn't find the data for them
   anywhere in the rom. besides that, the thing looks
   great! have fun! kero!

disclaimer

 i didn't make this game, character soft did.  i don't
 want the thing distributed with the rom cuz that's
 just bad and i'd never do it so you shouldn't cuz
 it's illegal and all that crap.
