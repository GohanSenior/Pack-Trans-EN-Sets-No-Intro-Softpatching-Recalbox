-Kamen Rider SD: Grandshocker no Yabou-
---------------------------------------

Kamen Rider SD: The Ambitions of Grand Shocker is an Role-Playing/Boardgame game for the NES/Famicom, featuring characters from multiple Kamen Rider series, all from the Riders' "Showa Era".  You'll play three different Kamen Rider teams, the Battle Team (Rider 1, Rider ZX, Rider RX) the Wild Team (Rider 2, Amazon, Stronger), and the Mechanic Team (Rider V3, Rider X, Super-1).

Due to text display limitations, the characters' names had to be truncated in battle text.

Rider 1		= No. 1
Rider 2		= No. 1
Rider V3	= V3
Rider X		= X
Rider RX	= RX
Rider ZX	= ZX
Super-1		= S-1
Stronger	= Strong
Amazon		= Amazon

Ambassador Hell / Amb. Hell	= Hell
Doctor G			= Dr. G
Apollogeist     		= Apollo
Jyumenki        		= Jyumen
Shadow Moon     		= Moon
General Jark / Gen. Jark    	= Jark
Dark Ambassador / Dark Amb.	= Dark
General Shadow / Gen. Shadow	= Shadow

Skyrider, Riderman and Tobei Tachibana also appears in the game but as assistance characters.  Thus, truncating their names in the game are unnecessary.  They don't appear during race battles.

Grand Shocker is a newly formed organization, formed by Great Leader, bringing back past foes of the Kamen Riders back to the fold.

Ambassador Hell		(from Kamen Rider)
Doctor G		(from Kamen Rider V3)
Apollo Geist		(from Kamen Rider X)
Jyumenki		(from Kamen Rider Amazon)
General Shadow		(from Kamen Rider Stronger)
Dark Ambassador		(from Birth of the 10th! Kamen Riders All Together!!)
