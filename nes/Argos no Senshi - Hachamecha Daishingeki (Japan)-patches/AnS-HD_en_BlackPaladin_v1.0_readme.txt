-BlackPaladin's The Warrior of Argus translation patch-
-------------------------------------------------------

*****************************************
*Argos no Senshi: Hachamecha Daishingeki*
*****************************************

Argos no Senshi was originally an arcade game in which you control a ressurected warrior who is chosen by the gods to defeat the beat king, Liger.  However, when the game was ported to the Famicom, the game was changed drastically.  Instead, game was changed into an action-adventure game, bordering on being an Role-Playing Action-RPG.  An overworld map was added with several different locations in which you fight to save five Indoras, all of whom can give "The Warrior of Argos" the power to reach the Sky Fortress and defeat the Beast King, Ligar. 

Tecmo did localize this this game in the United States and Europe under the name, "Rygar".  (The arcade game this game based on was also localized as "Rygar.)  However, the music in the Japanese version of the game is different compared to its localized counterparts.
