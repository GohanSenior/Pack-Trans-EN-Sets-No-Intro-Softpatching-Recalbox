======================================================
Version 1.02 changes:
Problems with the monster names solved.
The script was slightly corrected and read through for 
errors and contradictions, so it should look 
practically perfect (at least I hope so :))
Some other slight display problems solved. 

Background: Well, it was my first try to translate a
Japanese game and I did not even imagine that it'd be
completed.
The game is fully translated and thoroughly tested.
It uses sort of a "costricted" font - that was the 
only way to get at least SOME additional space
without serious ASM work, so don't be afraid of that.
The game itself is not a masterpiece but still fun
to play through and somehow reminded me of 
Uncharted Waters series.
Use a patching IPS utility of choice to apply the
patch.
Any comments and proposals would be highly 
appreciated - if you find any mistakes or errors -
please, let me know.
