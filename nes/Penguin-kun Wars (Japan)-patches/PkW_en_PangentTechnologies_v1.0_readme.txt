"Penguin-Kun Wars" is an action game released in 1985, in arcades by UPL, and on Famicom by ASCII.

Set in the village's original sports "DOJIBALL" tournament, unique animal characters face off across the table to throw a ball 10 times at each other.

The winner is the first side to throw all of the balls out of their area. Launch yourself through heated ball-battles, and aim for first place in the tournament.
