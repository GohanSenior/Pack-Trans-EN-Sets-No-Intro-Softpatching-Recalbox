Penguin Translations
--------------------

Penguin Kun Wars - Famicom - (c) 1985 ASCII - 100% Translation

Changes
-------
1.012 - When I released 1.011, way back when, someone pointed out that the title was infact 
Penguin Kun Wars.  As this is the way that the game is named in the all-english arcade 
version, I decided to redo the title screen once again. :P

1.011 - Made a much nicer Title Screen

1.01 - Fixed a bug where the game would freeze when you reach the Whack-A-Mole bonus round after round 2.

1.0 - Translation of Menu Screen, fixing of some Japanenglish sayings.

Notes
-----

I have now officially joined the translation scene :)

This is a patch for Penguin Wars for the Famicom.  It is 100% complete as the only japanese from it came from the title screen (thanks for the idea InVerse :)

Actually, I came upon this ROM by accident.  I was looking for Penguin Dream Story, and downloaded this one thinking that was it.

This is a neat little game, it is actually many games in one (Pong/Air Hockey, and Whack-A-Mole - for as far as I got).

This game translates the one word in the title screen, as well as fixing some annoying Japanenglish.  You Get A Set is now You Won A Set.
