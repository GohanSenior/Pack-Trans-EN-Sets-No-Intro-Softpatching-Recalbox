Jeremy (M'Rhan) - Head of Kakkoii Translations. He offered to give the
   Japanese scripts to his friend to translate. Without him, there
   would be no translation.

??? - Jeremy's friend, who translated the scripts. This person wishes
   to remain anonymous.

Varkon and Tetsuya - Translated the item list when I posted it on the
   CTC Board.

TheFreak and (wraith) - Volunteered for the beta testing.

Zackman - For taking the time to translate some of the script at the
   beginning, when no one else would look at it.

All the creators of hacking documents and utilities, because it was
that knowledge and array of tools that made this possible.

Notes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

I began working on Ys in August 1999, during a waiting period on
Romancing SaGa 1, another project I'm working on. I wanted to do it
for two reasons: to see if I could actually translate a game and do
all the hacking work myself, and because I love the Ys series. I had
made quite a bit of progress, figuring out everything about the text
storage with my mediocre romhacking knowledge. But the biggest setback
was the simple fact that no one wanted to translate the scripts. It
sat on my desk for about seven months before I got a break. After
giving Jeremy a little help with his own translation, he offered to
help me by taking those scripts to a friend of his to translate.
Within a few weeks, I had all of them back, completely translated. And
after a few more days, it was completely inserted.

This is the result of everyone's work, and I hope you enjoy it as much
as I enjoyed working on it.

Instructions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The file "ys1e.ips" must be patched to the original ROM image to play
this translation. Any IPS patching utility should work. Two commonly
used utilities are IPS.exe and Snestool. You can find these two
programs at most emulation websites.

*** Always keep a backup of the original ROM image. ***

To use IPS.exe, run this at a command prompt:

IPS <ROM NAME> <IPS NAME>

Snestool has a graphic interface that makes it easier. After starting
it, select "Use IPS", then select the IPS file, then the ROM image
that it should be used on.

The game has been thoroughly tested using the BioNES emulator, but I
believe it will also work on the latest beta of NESten. I haven't had
a chance to test it on NESten, since my computer doesn't seem to agree
with it. Other emulators such as NESticle and FWNES have some
graphical glitches when running Ys.
