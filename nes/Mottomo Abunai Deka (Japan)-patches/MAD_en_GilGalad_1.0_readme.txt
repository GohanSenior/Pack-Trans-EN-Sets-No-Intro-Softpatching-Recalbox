Game Details
---------------
Mottomo Abunai Deka has been translated and retitled to the name 
"The Most Dangerous Detectives". This game is based on the Japanese 
movie titled, Mottomo Abunai Deka, which is about two detectives 
Taka and Yuuji.

Taka and/or Yuuji begin their adventure against many enemies, later to 
find out they are against the Yakuza gang, The Silver Stars and many 
other enemies. You are armed with a pistol, along the way you can collect 
grenades and machine guns. The machine gun is a pistol on turbo with 
limited bullets. Grenades are also limited in number. Use them wisely.

There are a number of things that make this sub-par game interesting. The
first feature is that it's a one or two player game. You can also try
Taka or Yuuji on their own.

Most of this game is a side scroller where you battle against many enemies.
This game also features three mini-games which are target practice at a
shooting gallery, a shootout against a boss character, and last but not
least a fast paced car ride.

While playing the side scrolling levels, in order to switch weapons, press
start and then the "A" button to change weapons.

Last but not least, this translation is a Famicom game.

Update History
-----------------
Version 1.00 - First public release.


Patching Details
-----------------
1.)Use Lunar IPS to patch the rom. Or your favorite patching application.

2.)Make sure the "good name" is Mottomo Abunai Deka (J).nes . The size of the rom 
should be 128.00KB after being unzipped.

Emulation Details
------------------
This game is mapper #2, you should not have a problem finding a NES emulator to run 
the game. The game has been tried in most NES/Famicom emulators after the ASM hacks 
with success.

Known Issues
------------------
This game is fully translated. The game has an odd text display method that I'm
unable to change at this time. The text display does not clear the text on a screen
so the old text has to be over-written manually.
