TRANSBRC - RELEASE 1.1 TECHNOS ICE HOCKEY 

Translation by Cthulhu, Hack by Blibber.

NOTES - Your original file size should be 262,160.  This is probably my
favorite NES hockey game, thus the translation. 1.1 fixed the sound stuff
I messed up, fixed up one spelling of Russian (rusian), and touched up
some text.

Problems can be reported to blibber@sprint.ca.

Completion - Should be 100% (but little testing)
