A graphics bug that had some sprites out of place
when joining or leaving your party or just standing
in overworld maps has been squashed.

====================================================

Introduction:

Hello Destiny Fans!  This is a rather large .nfo file, but the creation of our 
DoaE-II English patch was a rather large project, underway for close to two 
years.  I would recommend that players and would-be ROM hackers alike read it, 
for it is literally chocked full of useful information.

A Policy Statement:

We "amateur" videogame hackers and translators do this purely for fun, for the 
love of the games, and also for the many educational experiences and benefits, 
with not even the slightest hint of personal monetary gain of any sort.  In 
fact, we are hardly "amateurs", except in the "not-for-profit" category. 
Collectively, we enjoy a huge amount of formal education, up to and including 
post-graduate degrees. Without the benefit of a source code, we have created a 
product that we claim is far superior to what a bunch of "paycheck grubbers" 
(so-called professionals) could wangle on their best day!

That said, let me issue a warning that if anyone (other than CAPCOM) comes up 
with the bright idea of pirating our patch, combining it with the DoaE-IIj ROM, 
and selling copies of a DoaE-IIe game for money, the "Liu Bei Legion" will hunt 
you down anywhere you might be in this whole wide world.  There is no place to 
hide!  I guarantee, if someone tries to sell our patch, his head will decorate a 
pointed stick in front of Xinye Castle!  Before we're through with you, Lu Bu 
will look like a one-legged Sunday School teacher.  'Nuff said...?  Okay, on 
with the show! :)

In the Beginning....

For a while, I didn't know where to start with this text.  I've been involved in 
many superb projects with a varied assortment of teammates.  Some projects have 
reached completion, while others have languished; but no single effort to date 
has meant more to me personally than Destiny of an Emperor-II.  Indeed, it is 
one of the two games that drew me into this hobby (the other one being Dragon 
Quest V).  My two all-time favorite videogames, RPG or otherwise, are Destiny 
of an Emperor (I) and Dragon Warrior (Quest) IV.

The People Involved:

Rather than talk about the game itself at the outset (for true fans KNOW both 
the game and Romance of Three Kingdoms legend...), I will discuss instead, the 
special people involved in each stage of the project.

Me (Wildbill):

As I stated, DoaE-I is tied for my all time favorite game.  Let's face it; the 
game is downright addictive, and I must have played it at least 50 times through 
the years since it's release in 1989.  As of 1997, I had no idea that a sequel 
even existed, as I did not follow the export market.  But then I discovered the 
emulation world quite by accident, searching for information about a possible 
English prototype of Dragon Quest (Warrior) V, and a few weeks later I stumbled 
into Zophar's Domain, Demi's Rom Hacking WWW Board, and a now defunct RPG news 
website, all of which followed amateur translation efforts.  This was in the 
days of the "FF2 and FF3 Translation Wars", and it was in this millieu that I 
first heard about the Japanese DoaE-II game.

Cataclysm-X:

What a character CX is!  But he and I have always enjoyed cordial relations, and 
it was CX who first attempted a translation of DoaE-II, teamed up with Shujin 
Rik, as translator.  But CX ran into all sorts of problems with what is now 
known as the "ROM-from-Hell", especially with a form of text compression invoked 
by a system that uses thousands of bytes for "substrings".  I followed CX's 
progress and rantings about the technical challenges, then finally learned 
enough about the emulation world to establish a dialogue with CX and other 
people who were working on projects of interest to me.

CAPCOM of America:

I wrote CAPCOM a very polite and passionate letter, requesting that they bring 
DoaE-II to America, on PC or anything, but they didn't even afford me the 
courtesy of a reply.

Dark Force:

For several years, DF has been a mainstay in the J2e and DeJap translation 
"companies", and has lent his talented hand to several major releases, including 
FF4.  DF also has an abiding interest in the Ro3K legend, both the Chinese and 
Japanese languages, and advanced hacking techniques, including assembly language 
(ASM).  DF took over the DoaE-II project, a new person for me to badger on
message boards, about progress.  Eventually, DF and I had several ICQ chats and 
exchanged a few e-mails.  It was through his tutelage that I learned many 
additional details about DoaE-II's substring compression, and ASM problems 
associated with converting its extensive Chinese ideographs into English.

A Turning Point:

Then, events took a fateful turn.  About mid-1998, Dark Force told me one 
day that he would probably never get around to finishing DoaE-II, that it was 
too time-consuming with all the other things he had to do (and quite possibly 
the toughest Famicom hack ever attempted), that I should take over the reins of
the project and look for the necessary cast of talented people to help me get 
the job done.  So, I did exactly that, became a project manager, or facilitator, 
as my only real technical roles have been scriptwriting, some tile work on Shop 
signs, the English font, the Chinese table file, some translations of both 
Japanese and Chinese lists, and a hand in the Destiny website design and 
maintenance.

Jim Price:

Through the first half of 1998, Jim Price and I had worked on Technos Samurai 
for Famicom, a game we completed that became one of the first releases of the 
newly created Confederated Translation Company (following Magic's SFC Villgust).  
As work on T-S was winding down, I asked Jim if he would become the chief hacker 
for the DoaE-II project, and he agreed.  Within a few days Jim had dumped the 
script, and our project was off and running.  Jim and I started from the English 
patch worked on by Dark Force, one that already had a rough English Prologue, Introduction, and font, plus a few other features.  Within a short time Jim had
some more English menues built, and had loaded a few weapons, items, tactics, castles, and even some warlords.  Jim also found the code to expand the menu
boxes, created multi-character tiles to fit in long menu words  like "Tactics",
and started the Title Page conversion.

Musashi:

Musashi was one of the first people I met in the translation scene.  A 
contributor to the Earthbound Zero Prototype Dumping Fundraise, Musashi is also 
a dyed-in-the-wool Destiny and Ro3K fan.  When I told him I had received the 
project from Dark Force (about the same time as I told Jim), I asked him to join 
the team, too.  Thus, Jim, Musashi, and I formed an early triumvirate in those 
heady early days of this CTC/Destiny/Gaijin DoaE-II project, about September 
1998.  It was Musashi who re-translated the Prologue, Introduction, and 
eventually, large blocks of the 40,000+ byte Bank-1 dialogue, and ALL of the 40+ 
kilobyte Bank-2 dialogue.  Musashi also helped design the Destiny Translation 
website, and applied some rather impressive finishing touches to those Shop 
signs I started.  All of the translations loaded by the previous patch owners 
were eventually supplanted by our own work, but having it to start from was 
still invaluable to our efforts.

Faraday:

Ah, Faraday!  He is a translator deluxe, from merry olde England, and a pure joy 
to work with.  He prefers to translate scripts of games that he loves (and DoaE 
does not represent one of his favorite genres), but nevertheless, everything he 
did for DoaE-II was absolutely suberb, meticulously researched, and placed in 
context with the styles of the period.  Faraday translated the lion's share of 
the Bank-1 dialogue, and about 30% of Bank-3 before he had to take a leave-of-
absense to deal with some personal issues.  If anyone wishes to play some of the 
fine works translated by Faraday, try SFC Villgust, Technos Samurai, or Phantasy 
Star Gaiden, all produced by CTC teams!

Braxton:

Braxton did a lot of quality work on the DoaE-II Title Page, including the 
conversion of "Tenchi wo Kurai" to "Destiny of an Emperor".  Brax also did the 
sword, and "The Story of Zhuge Liang" logo.  That's the beauty of the CTC WWW 
Board.  Usually, when someone posts a request for help, that call is answered.

Robin:

Robin is a good friend and a fellow RPG-lover, also from England, who is a 
pretty darn good self-taught, Kanji-reading Japanese translator.  I asked Robyn 
to look at the Kana-only DoaE-II bank script, after Faraday ran into conflicts 
with his free time.  But DoaE-II has a lot of strange readings that are military 
in nature, so Robyn and I worked it out that the most efficient use of his time 
was to translate Kanji projects like Mystic Ark.  But Robyn was willing to 
tackle the DoaE-II script, and to me, that makes him valuable part of the 
effort.

Michael Wishlow:

Mr. Wishlow is either a con-artist or a thief.  At the very least, he is a 
person of very low integrity, for I made a flawed judgment, myself, then Wishlow 
completed the debacle by absconding with sixty U.S. Dollars ($60).  Times were 
getting desperate for the project in late 1998 and early 1999.  Musashi was 
coming through with Bank-2, but about the time Faraday got 30% through Bank-3, 
and had to halt his DoaE-II work permanently, Jim Price's computer crashed and 
he went incommunicado from the rest of us for several months.  Musashi and I 
kept working on the translations, Chinese table file, etc.; and I kept 
searching for more pool translators.  That's when I decided it would be worth 
$60 (about the price of a high-end game cart), to "contract" with Wishlow for a 
Bank-4 translation.

If any of my Canadian friends want to contact Wishlow about getting this money
back, hop to it, and use the $60 to buy a game cart for dumping, or something
similar....

Demi:

After being screwed by Wishlow, things started looking up again.  While working 
in Japan, Demi found a complete full-color 208-page Strategy Guide for DoaE-II, 
and mailed it to me when he returned to Ohio.  I scanned it into graphic form, 
and send copies around to the various members of the team.  I even uploaded it 
for a time, when much of CTC was hosted by Postman77 and his domain, the-liu.  
This guide was invaluable, because it correlated Chinese ideographs of every 
name and feature in the game (using Furigana), with their corresponding Kana 
transcriptions.  This unlocked the door to a successful translation of 
EVERYTHING in the game, especially warlord names, some of which were "mangled" 
beyond recognition in their Katakana forms.

Izack:

Izack, a Destiny fan from Singapore, volunteered to be our Chinese translator, 
and provided just about everything we needed in that area.  His biggest 
contribution was translating all of the new Tactics in DoaE-II, and he did it 
within mere days!  DoaE-II uses 50 Tactics, 22 of which were present in DoaE-I, 
so that left 28 new ones, including 10 special battle array Tactics.  
Additionally, Izack translated all of the warlord names from the Strategy Guide, 
and helped immensely with the Weapons List, including conversions of weapons 
with later era Japanese names, to appropriate Chinese weapons of the Ro3K 
period.  He even suggested that we re-name an episode featuring a bottle of 
Japanese Sake, to Chinese Jiu, which we happily did!

Taskforce:

One day, Musashi and I were talking about all of the setbacks, key among them, 
Jim's mysterious disappearance at the very time when he was reporting progress 
on an automated script insertion utility.  I realized that with over half of the 
game already translated, I needed to do something to jumpstart the project.  I 
made one more futile attempt to contact Jim, then went to one of my most trusted 
and reliable workmates and friends in this hobby field, Taskforce.  TF and I had 
already finished Villgust, and were planning Phantasy Star Gaiden.  Even though 
I knew TF wasn't a history buff, or a big military strategy game fan, he was 
certainly capable of writing a script inserter. So, I explained about Jim, and 
asked TF if he would modify his Villgust inserter to load Bank-1, and possibly 
2.  The rest (hee-hee-hee) is history!  To synopsize briefly, Taskforce picked 
up a very early stage of possibly the hardest NES hack ever, and saw it through 
to conclusion.  As such, he is the biggest hero of this project.  Eventually, 
Jim did re-appear, and gave his blessing to TF taking over, but not before he 
(Jim) saw my Chinese table file (many months in the making), posted at the 
Destiny website.  Jim grabbed that table file and dumped all of the Chinese 
warlord names for us, as such has been the unselfish spirit of our extended 
Destiny team!  But much more is to be revealed about TF's work with Insertion 
and Pointer Tools, his never-ending wrestling match with Substring Compression, 
the dreaded "F2" Warlord List, and all of the other hacking chores he 
accomplished.  Look in his technical notes (below) for much more information on 
these details.

Varkon:

Sometimes, good things come in threes, and Godsend Number Two was soon to emerge 
on the scene.  Shortly after Taskforce joined the project, I cajoled one of our 
excellent Mystic Ark translators, Varkon, to translate that very Bank-4 that 
Wishlow had been paid $60 to do.  Varkon, a former winner of a competition 
called the Japan Bowl, proved to be a translating dynamo!  He believed that 
translating one kilobye of DoaE-II script per hour was slow, but it's not 
really, when compared to the 60 or more hours the rest of us spend editing, 
preparing, and inserting that same 20 kilobyte script that took him about 20 
hours to translate.  At first blush it might appear that the translator has
the easiest job of all.  Not so.  All serious translating teams have learned
(sometimes painfully) that projects go absolutely nowhere without serious,
competent, dedicated translators.  The work is exhausting, and translator
burnout is common.  But Varkon finished Bank-4 so quickly (and it became
painfully apparent that Faraday wasn't going to return), that I prevailed upon
him to finish the last 70% of Bank-3.  Once he settled down to it, Varkon flew through the rest of the script quickly, and just like that, most of the DoaE-II translations were completed, achieving our first huge milestone in this project!

Jair:

The third missing link in assuring completion was ASM hacking skills.  Taskforce 
eventually loaded the four banks, while the rest of us beta tested, edited, 
wrote FAQs, translated manuals, etc., but one of the the biggest bars to 
completion (after bank-loading) was the ASM hacking necessary to alter the 
routines that controlled how the names in the "F2" Warlord List were displayed 
on Status and Battle pages.  The names displayed just fine in straight 
dialogues, inserted as a process of not-so-simple variables, as most fell into 
the realm of substring compression.  For this reason, editing and formatting 
script required that all names reside entirely on one line of insertable 
dialogue.  But the biggest challenge was displaying the Chinese (ideographical) 
names in Pinyin (English), because each Chinese ideograph used four bytes, 
stacked two-over-two, and the four segments were stored at random in a huge 
Chinese font table!  In the simple chart below, the 12 c's represent the 
segments (of three ideographs) that were available for each name conversion:

cccccc                Zhuge_
cccccc   to become:   _Liang    where:   _ is a blank space.

Enter, Jair... yet another contributor to the Earthbound Zero Fundraise.  To 
make a long story short, Jair volunteered to solve these conversion problems, 
and actually did so during the Christmas holiday period of 1999.  As Taskforce 
proclaimed on the CTC WWW board, "Jair is da man!"

Yan Zhang:

Yan Zhang is a student at a scientific and technical magnet school in Virginia, 
and says he enjoys the Ro3K legend and games immensely.  During the earlier part 
of 1999, I read a FAQ he started drafting for DoaE-I, then e-mailed Yan, and 
asked him if he would volunteer to write an official DoaE-II English translation 
Project FAQ and Walkthrough.  As of the time of writing this document, Yan's FAQ 
is about 97% finished.

Jainsafel:

A really nice person from the University of Texas in Austin, who is working on 
our project's official translation of the Destiny of an Emperor-II Game Manual.  
The actual document was severely battered when I received it with the DoaE-IIj 
gamepak, but still readable.  At the time of this writing, Jainsafe1's work is 
still on-going, but her translations of some of the Tactics are printed in a 
section below.

Postman77:

P77 was our Destiny (and CTC WWW board) host for about a year, allowing us 
server space and access to his domain, the-liu.  We would still be with P77 had 
his partnership not failed with the other server owners.  Hopefully, P77 says he 
will be back in the server business sometime during the winter of 2000.

Randy:

A prince of a fellow who offered us a domain for the Lennus-II Translation 
Project, and graciously granted the latitude to support a number of projects, 
including a new home for Destiny and Magic Translations.  Thanks, Randy!  I hope 
you will find some pleasure playing DoaE-IIe while we continue working on 
Lennus-II.

World-wide Destiny Fans (and fellow team members):

All of you... you're the best!  Concerning DoaE-II, I've never had a crank e-
mail from anyone, proving that a mature game and series like Destiny of an 
Emperor also attracts a mature audience.  It's a real pleasure to share this 
game's English patch with y'all!  To the dozens of people who have worked on 
this game, offered help, and sent encouragement over the past year-and-a-half, I 
hereby dedicate our Destiny of an Emperor-II English translation patch to ALL of 
you!

------------------------------------------------
Tips for Playing Our English Version of DoaE-II:
------------------------------------------------

I don't want to divulge spoilers, but this game is a little different from the 
original, so consider this section a "Tip" page, just like in the game manuals.

(Note:  I rate the Nintendo-of-America version of DoaE-I a "G", whereas the Ro3K 
novel and the DoaE-II Japanese script read more realistically, as to how 
soldiers might act, fight, and speak while embroiled in a long-running war.  
Therefore, as compared to DoaE-Ie, from NOA, I'd rate our game at least "PG", or 
possibly "PG-13". But as I mentioned, there are some notable differences 
between the original and DoaE-IIe, so here are tips to help players get off to a 
good start.)

1.  The first five warlords possess full suites of weapons and armor, but 
players will need to use the Equip command before fighting, or even the little 
"frito-bandito" types in the countryside will beat you to a bloody pulp in just 
a few rounds!

2.  Be sure to designate a Stratigist, or you will not be able to use your TP!

3.  Equipable weapons are warlord-specific, instead of being fully 
interchangeable.  Be careful when one general leaves the party, and another one 
joins and inherits all of the old equipment.  You may need to visit the armory 
to purchase a new weapon.

4.  There is a Vault feature in this game, for storing excess items.  It is 
located to the immediate right of the Save-Game desk in Headquarters Buildings.

5.  There are many useful new items in DoaE-II, like Elixirs for restoring TP in 
the field, and Tents for regaining both HP and TP.

6.  Elixirs A, B, C, and D carried over from DoaE-I, but we did a more literal 
translation than NOA, naming them Herbal, Copper, Silver, and Gold Elixirs.

7.  Previously defeated warlords are not necessarily recruitable after you clear 
a battle scenario.  The number of people you can rally to your side and/or keep 
on the rolls at the Billetting Facilities are much more limited than in DoaE-I.

8.  For increasing levels more quickly, you may use Training Gymnasiums in 
various towns, but it's very expensive, and you can accomplish the same thing by 
fighting in the countryside, plus earn much needed "Jin" (Gold).  When your 
level is high enough, the Gym operator will tell you to seek a more advanced 
facility.

9.  ChiTuMa is available in this game, when Guan Yu leaves the Luoyang area with 
Liu Bei's wives in tow, those fine ladies, Gan & Mi.  This is realistic to the 
plot of the Ro3K novel, for Cao Cao gave Guan Yu the "Red Hare" in an attempt to 
entice his continued service.  Try giving the horse to any warlord (starting 
with Guan Yu).  Equip ChiTuMa and see what happens.  I guarantee, you'll like
it, a LOT!

10.  There are regular Steeds for sale in this game, too, but they are not used 
to lure enemy warlords to your side, as in DoaE-I.  You will need to experiment 
with Steeds to learn what they can do for you!

11.  Many Scrolls are available, that can be read for effecting certain tactical 
actions.  Some are special, essential to advancing in the game, while others are 
handy for a one-time execution of standard Tactics in regular battles.

12.  Significant new Tactics were designed for DoaE-II, so as soon as you learn 
a new one, use it to see what it does.  Check our special Tactics Section for a
brief description of some of those new Tactics.

13.  A few familiar Tactics and Items are missing in DoaE-II, like Gui Huan and 
Gullwing (the warping tools).  But the game is quite expansive, and if returning 
to previously settled areas becomes necessary, the necessary avenues of approach 
will be provided.

14.  Unlike DoaE-I, most of the attacking and healing Tactics may be directed 
toward either a single person or the entire group.  Manipulate the cursor 
buttons to choose between single or multiple options. (Note: Some multiple 
options are availably ONLY in battle mode.)

15.  There are quite a few bugs in various emulators, whether playing Japanese 
or patched ROMs, especially in battle mode.  I recommend fwNES V302 for the
best emulation and fewest lockups.

16.  There are also a few minor item bugs in both the Japanese and patched ROMs, 
especially regarding Smoke Bombs.  This is either a CAPCOM glitch, or else we 
need a new dump and/or better emulation support.  Use Save-States frequently to 
safeguard against lockups.

17.  The game begins in Xuzhou, when the Emperor and Cao Cao dispatch the 
Brotherhood to chase down Yuan Shao, who is fleeing toward his own brother's 
domain (Yuan Shu) of Jizhou, holding the Imperial Seal that he stole from the 
ashes of Luoyang.  This is very realistic to the actual novel, except Xuzhou is 
really Lu Bu's fiefdom, who appears in DoaE-II within the context of his 
expected behavior, but in scenarios that are not necessarily in the correct 
chronological order of actual history.

18.  The subtitle of the game is "The Story of Zhuge Liang", who may have been 
the greatest Chinese Tactician of them all.  Zhuge Liang is recruited about one-
quarter of the way through the game.  Be careful how you go about waking him up!

19.  Although the characters and castles are very similar in DoaE-I and II, the 
plot is vastly different.  If you enjoyed DoaE-I, I believe you will LOVE DoaE-
II.

20.  There are some innovations in this game that became standard features in 
SNES games, sequences that I never saw in an NES game until I played DoaE-II.  
These tips are not all-inclusive, but should be helpful until Yan has finishes
and releases his FAQ/Walkthrough.

----------------------------
The DoaE-II Tactics Listing:
----------------------------

You will need to master many of these tactics in order to advance and win the 
game, especially those counter-tactics against certain enemy actions.

I included the original Japanese translations in the first chart, so players 
could see how similar (or misleading) they were, compared to the actual Chinese 
definitions provided by Izack.

* Also used in DoaE-I
**Used in DoaE-I and loaded into DoaE-II, but not actually used in the game.

Now, presenting Jainsafel's translation of the new Avalanche and Formation 
Tactics, from the DoaE-IIj game manual...

DoaE Manual Translation v1.1
by Jainsafel

pg. 35

-----

Avalanche Tactics

Causes gigantic trees or rocks to fall from above and knock down the enemy.  
However, it cannot be used when there are no mountains or hills nearby.  It can 
be used against single enemies as well as the entire enemy group.

-----

Drop Wood Tactic        [Luo Mu]        (Consumes 4 SP)

Causes a huge tree to fall above the enemies' heads, knocking them down.

-----

Wooden Stream Tactic    [Liu Mu]        (4 SP)

With this powerful drop wood tactic, gigantic trees are made to fall like rain 
and knock down the enemy.

-----

Drop Rocks Tactic       [Luo Shi]       (6 SP)

Causes an enormous stone to fall from above the enemies' heads, crushing their 
army.

-----

Catapult Tactic [Tou Shi]       (8 SP)

Using a catapult, continuously launches stones which crush the enemy.

-----

Valley of Rocks Tactic  [Ji Shi]        (10 SP)

Invites the enemy into a valley (or some such) with a blocked exit, and drops 
huge stones and trees from above, knocking the enemy army down beyond all 
recognition.

-----

pg. 41

-----

Formation Tactics

Lu Bei's army, while fighting, can alter their attack and defense power, ect., 
by means of their formation layout.  Ensure successful battles by changing your 
formation according to the situation.

-----

Scatter [San Kai]       (Consumes 0 SP)

The usual senario is that of a non-laid-out formation.  If you use this tactic 
when your formation is laid out, then it will return to that regular state.

-----

Crane Formation [He Yi] (Consumes 8 SP)

Loses defensive power in place of heightened attack power.  Its effectiveness is 
particularly evident in battles fought on level ground.

-----

Square Formation        [Heng Fang]     (Consumes 12 SP)

Raises both attack and defensive power, but agility becomes extremely low.  When 
up against Bai Ma this formation becomes very weak.

-----

White Horse Formation   [Bai Ma]        (Consumes 8 SP)

This was in "The Art of War": The art of war considers 'godspeed' an aim.  
Should you lay out in this formation, attack and defensive power will not 
change.  However, your agility will rise and you will probably be able to turn 
the fight in your favor.

The true value of this formation will be demonstrated when you employ it against 
the enemy's Heng Fang Tactic.

-----

pg. 42

-----

Fish Scale Formation    [Ya Lin]        (8 SP)

Decreases the Tactics success rate of your enemy by one-half.  Raises your 
attack and defense power as well, but the attack power of the commanders on 
either wing lowers to almost nothing -- though their Tactical success rate 
rises.

-----

Wedge Formation [Feng Jian]     (16 SP)

Attack power and agility rises quite a bit, but the attack power of the 
commanders of either wing (the head and 5th unit of the line) become next to 
nothing.  (However, compared to the other three units their defensive power 
becomes the strongest.)  Especially effective on level ground.

-----

Brotherhood Formation   [Yi Wen Zhi]    (16 SP)

Attack power and agility rise, but defense power goes down.  Effective on level 
ground.

-----

pg. 43

-----

Backs to Water Formation        [Bei Shui]      (24 SP)

A formation Tactic of life or death.  Attack power doubles, and fierce fighting 
(a critical blow) occurs with more ease.  But in place of that, defense power is 
lowered by half.  Can only be used if near a water-source.  Again, since you 
certainly cannot retreat, if you need to, use San Kai then lay out in some other 
formation.

-----

Silence Formation       [Jing Mo]       (32 SP)

Temporarily erases your form while in front of the enemy, making it easy to 
dodge enemy attacks.  Defensive power also doubles.  However, you become unable 
to use Recovery Tactics.

-----

Eight Diagrams Formation        [Ba Gua]        (48 SP)

The strongest Formation Tactic; said to have its origins in The Art of War's 
antiquity.  We hear that it involves things called the Gates of Life and Death, 
but no more details are known.

Note:  Since I pasted this version of Jainsafel's translation work in this .nfo 
file, she and Jair have teamed up to produce a color version of many of the 
pages in the actual game manual.  This work can be accessed from the Destiny 
website.

----------------------------
Taskforce's Technical Notes:
----------------------------

Well, I'm not really sure where to start.  There were many features in this game 
that were not the usual fare for me, nothing at all like the translations I have 
done in the past.  I will discuss these issues on a case-by-case basis.

Pointers:

Well, these were certainly fun!  The typical way a pointer works is 
characterized by the usage of two bytes that point to an address in the ROM.  
Typically, pointers fall within the current bank and are reversed.  Usually, the 
last byte of the address is followed by its first byte, that can have a value 
added or subtracted.  Well, the pointers in this game worked that way, but they 
certainly weren't listed that way.  Instead, the pointer bytes were split into 
two separate groups.  Within a given section, all of the pointer's second bytes 
were grouped together first, then a similar group of their first bytes followed 
them in the ROM.

"So," you say, "what's the big deal?"  Well, for one thing it caused the 
programming of insertion tools to be a lot more tedious.  That was a bit of a 
challenge.  To begin with, just finding and identifying them was a big pain, 
that is, until I finally discovered how they were stored.  Thanks go out to Jim 
Price, for giving me a nudge in the right direction.  After I read his text 
document, it surely speeded up the process of finding them.

Substrings:

I've examined a lot of games, but I have never seen a substring system as 
complex as this one.  Let me explain how a substring works...  You store whole 
words or groups of frequently used letters and symbols in one part of the ROM, 
then use a couple of bytes to call them in your text.  This is a form of text 
compression that is used to save bytes.  Let's say that you have the word "The" 
150 times in a rom.  You make it a substring and use the bytes EA 02 to call 
that word when you need it.  "The" contains three bytes, but the code to call it 
uses only two.  Thus, you save one byte each time you call that word, a savings 
of 150 bytes.  Those 150 bytes can now be used for fitting more text into the 
game's dialogue.  This primitive, but effective form of pseudo-compression may 
be a great tool for adding space to a ROM, but it's hell to program.  And with
DoaE-2 having more than 1,000 substrings in the japanese ROM, they were a 
real pain to deal with.

Here is a comparison:  Breath of Fire II, an SNES game much larger than DoaE-2, 
has only 256 of these substrings.  Theoretically, DoaE-2 has 4 times as many, 
but we didn't wind up using 1000+ English substrings because our combinations 
used more bytes on average.  I'd estimate that we still had about 700 or so, and 
defining them was a Herculean challenge.  I think that DoaE-2's inserter is 
probably the largest for any fan translation to date, although much of that is 
just repetitious code, dealing with each case of substring insertion.

The F2 Warlord List:

As if 700 English dialogue substrings wasn't enough, the dreaded F2 Warlord List 
also turned out to be a substring list!  Well, this was the hardest part for me.  
I wrestled with how to get this to work for many an hour.  I would start to work 
on it, then restart that work again, over and over it seemed.  Let me explain 
why it was the hardest thing for me in the entire ROM:

Problem 1:  It wasn't just the names in this list.  Each name was accompanied by 
a list of statistics and other code that told the ROM what warlord picture to 
display, what Chinese to print, etc.  Thanks to Jair, we were able to use the 
Chinese bytes for English space, and still have enough room left over for the F2 
(Pinyin) names of the warlords.  Otherwise, we would have run way short of 
bytes.  As I mentioned, stored among the F2 data were the generals' Strength, 
Agility, Intelligence, and a lot of other attributes.

Problem 2:  F2 Pointers...  The F2 Pointers, as with the other banks, didn't 
fall into the same order as the text did.  While the first pointer might lead to 
the general listed first, the second one might point to the fourth general 
instead of the second.  You might say this made the story a bit interesting, 
especially during Alpha testing!

I had to devise some way to keep all of those extra bytes intact and the 
pointers properly straight, too, while being able to move things around so I 
could fit in all of the English letters we needed.  Whew, that was quite a 
chore!  I switched from manual to auto-insertion more than once, but finally 
wound up using the auto method.  It wasn't quite as hard as I figured, but still 
took some manual adjusting of the pointers to get it 100% accurate.

Menu Expansion:

I've done my share of this in the past.  The Gun first showed me this technique 
in Villgust.  I quickly reverse engineered the patch he handed me and learned 
the ins and outs of it for the Villgust ROM.  I took what I knew from there and 
before long determined how it worked with the Game Gear, in Phantasy Star 
Gaiden.  The NES, however, does not use the same screen mapping conditions as 
the other two platforms, which have similar screen mappers (at least with the 
games I did).  The NES horizontal and vertical start positions of a menu are 
contained in the same byte for this game (and others I've seen, too).  This was 
a bit different.  However, The width and height worked about the same, so after 
I found that - and with a little help from a doc left by Jim Price - I figured 
out how they worked, and put this task behind me.

An Unexpected Problem:

In December 1999, I lost the current source to the inserter and the most recent 
I had was several months old.  There still remained one mistake, but I corrected 
that manually when inserting.  Thank goodness it was far enough along that I 
didn't have to rebuild it.  There was a lot of missing code in there that I 
would have had to rewrite.  Luckily, the EXE I had was the current one, and was 
usable.  Had it not been, this project could have been delayed even more weeks 
or months.

Conclusion:

A couple of final notes:  This is the largest game I have done to date, topping 
even Villgust.  The overall text size is about 100k, which is absurd when you 
stop to consider that the ROM is only 512k total.  That's 1/5 of the total ROM, 
unheard of, save for this game!  Villgust, which is twice its size, only had 
about 85k total, if I remember correctly. (It will probably top it again later 
this year when we rework the Villgust script.)  The inserter weighed in at a 
final size of 400k.  That's just over 100k less than the ROM size.  The source 
(which I do not have a current version of) was well over 2000 lines, and over 
100k.

- Thanks to Jim Price for the info he left about the game.  It really helped.

- Thanks to my long-time teammates, Wildbill and Faraday, just because they are 
good friends and we always look forward to working together on our next 
project(s).  It's good to have you back, Faraday.  I'm sorry you had to go 
through the loss of your father, Wildbill.  I've been there, and I know what 
it's like.  I knew you're beginning to come to terms with it, and I hope that 
fond memories are what stay with you in times to come.

- Thanks to Jair, who has become a good friend as well.  He really saved our 
butts on this project!

Musashi's Project Notes:
------------------------

Destiny of an Emperor 2 is why I became involved in romhacking and translation.  
I had run across Dragonsoft, an old translation site working on games such as 
Romancing Saga 3 and Destiny of an Emperor 2. Once I saw the name Destiny of an 
Emperor 2 I tried to contact the team in the hopes that I could assist them 
somehow.  Well things didn't work out right away and I turned to other projects 
to learn the ins and outs of both romhacking and translating.  Thus was born 
Gaijin Productions. I personally have invested a great deal of time into 
research the Three Kingdoms era and its related fields.  I've read several 
version of the novel in addition to researching everything from Sino-Japanese 
(Japan was called Wa) relations from that time, to Barbarian nations, to Han 
society and culture, to Chinese methods of divining.  I am  also a history major 
and have taken many courses in an effort to comprehensively study China (among 
other topics).  While my knowledge of the Three Kingdoms era is not perfect, I 
will say that it is comprehensive.  I've done more than play Three Kingdoms 
themed video games and read poorly translated novelizations (though I admittedly 
have done both to an extensive degree).  Game-wise, Destiny of an Emperor 2 is a 
superb improvement over the first.  Working with the Destiny team has been an 
immense pleasure and a learning experience.  I have attempted to keep the story 
historically faithful without violating Capcom's own spin on things.  
Unfortunately size limitations have forced us to butcher things here and there.  
Despite the severe reduction of the scripts the game is still a Three Kingdoms 
game, with all the bells and whistles.  What I do want players to realize is 
that playing a Three Kingdoms game or reading a Three Kingdoms novel does not 
make you a historian of the era.  If want to claim any sort of expertise in this 
area I suggest you dedicate some time in a genuine academic pursuit of the era.  
The internet and your local library will not do.  And remember that Destiny of 
Emperor 2 is just a game.  Its purpose is not to teach you history, its to have 
fun.

Jair's ASM Technical Notes:
---------------------------

I started work on Destiny of an Emperor II in the summer of 1999 and finished 
around Christmas, six months and 63 pages of notes later.  I originally offered
to try implementing a useful DTE, but Taskforce had a much more serious problem
for me to tackle.  The original Japanese game stores two names for each warlord,
the Japanese Katakana name and the Chinese name.  The Chinese names appear on
the General screen, the army status screen, and the battle screen.  Taskforce
quickly realized that these Chinese names could not be easily replaced.  That
part of the game would have to be reprogrammed to load and display the English
names.

That was where I came in.  After many hours of disassembling, tracing, 
experimenting, and head-scratching, I started to understand how the routine 
worked, and I figured out how to load a single letter to the screen.  My first 
attempt at a full routine failed to do anything useful, for reasons I don't even 
remember offhand.  Discouraged and busy with schoolwork, I gave up for the time 
being.  In December, my determination returned, partly out of pride and partly 
because I didn't want to let the rest of the Destiny team down.  After a 
torturous sequence of debugging, more experimentation, howls of bafflement, and
occasional dances of joy (literally -- ask my roommate), it was finished.  The
technical details are too long to explain here, although I do plan to write up
my entire experience some day.  The routine begins at 7c043 for anyone
interested in studying it.

Working on DoaE-II was usually baffling and frustrating.  This was truly the ROM 
from hell, at least to my beginning ASM skills.  On the other hand, this project 
improved my abilities immeasurably.  And as wretched as I felt during the months 
of confusion, I felt wonderful when I fired up the ROM that last time and saw 
the battle screen come up with English names sitting properly in their places.  
I was so thankful that God had blessed me with the skill and luck to succeed.  
It was also wonderful working with such a great group of people!  I feel honored 
to have been a part of this project, and I hope you all enjoy the game!

Special thanks to:

- loopy, for releasing the debugger-enabled build of loopyNES, without which I 
simply would have failed.

- The author of 6502.txt, which I constantly refer to for basic 6502 assembly 
information.

- Yoshi, for his NES technical documentation, a priceless source of information 
about registers and the PPU.

- Taskforce, for putting incredible effort and dedication into a game he doesn't 
even especially like!

- Wildbill, for working tirelessly to hold this project together and get it 
done.

- Everyone, especially those who have helped me over the years, those who hang 
out and waste time with me on ICQ, and yeah ....  All you know who you are.  
Yay!  ^_^

Presenting: The DoaE-IIe V1.10 patch

-----------------
What's Been Done:
-----------------

--Everything that we know of.

------------------
What's Left to Do:
------------------

--Nothing that we're aware of.  (We did leave a few Chinese ideographical 
nomenclatures on the status page that may or may not be changed in future patch 
enhancements.)

-----------
Known Bugs:
-----------

--The occasional battle lockup with many emulators.

--A CAPCOM or dumping glitch with the item-numbering system that occurs 
sometimes with the Smoke Bombs.

--A CAPCOM or dumping glitch involved with transferring TNT between warlords.

-----------------------------------
Additional Thank You's (Taskforce):
-----------------------------------

--Loopy.  Like Jair said, the loopyNES debugger allowed him to figure out what 
the heck was going on in the indescribably screwy name-display routines.  
Without it, that part of the project would have failed entirely and you'd be 
seeing Chinese names on the battle and other screens!

--YOSHi, for his NES technical doc, especially the section on the PPU.

--The author of 6502.txt.

-----------
Conclusion:
-----------

Since this is a public beta, please let us know of any bugs other than
occasional, unsolvable battle lock.

Wow! The others and I (Wildbill) may have said it ALL already, but I guess the 
most amazing thing is that we actually finished this sometimes frustrating 
project, one of the best examples of teamwork I've ever been involved with.  
Thanks to all of you.  It took us a long time to complete, but I feel it was 
well worth the effort.  And now, here it is for all of us to enjoy forever!
