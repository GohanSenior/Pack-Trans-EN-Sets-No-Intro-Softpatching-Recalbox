INTROUCTION
***********
Once upon a time in the Heian era, there was a boy born from a peach.
It was a time when Japan was ravaged by demons known as Oni.
At the age of six, he stood up and said he was going to journey to Oni Island.
Exterminate the Oni servants, but you won't make it if you don't find the loyal
dog, monkey and pheasant companions.

Heroes and heroines from folklore, like Kintarou, Urashima, the old man from Hanasaka
and the Moon Princess are all performing in this together.

Now, begin this side-splitting journey!

(there is much more backstory to this, but I couldn't get it translated in time.
If someone wants, I've got a transcription from the manual I can send.)

PATCHING INSTRUCTIONS
*********************
 I've included a program that will both expand the ROM and apply the patch.
 Be sure to patch Momotarou Den(S)etsu, not Momotarou Den(t)etsu.

 If you want to expand it manually, you will need to add an extra 256KB to the ROM with
 a hex editor. Then copy the data at addresses $3C010-4000F of the original ROM over
 $7C010-8000F of the expanded ROM (it must exist in both places).
 THEN apply the IPS.

EMULATION ISSUES
****************
 Not aware of any.
