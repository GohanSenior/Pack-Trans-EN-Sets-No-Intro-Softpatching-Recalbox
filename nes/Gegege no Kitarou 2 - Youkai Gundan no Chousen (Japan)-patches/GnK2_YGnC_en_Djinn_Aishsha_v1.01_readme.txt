Gegege no Kitaro 2 - Yokai Gundan no Chosen
======================================================
Background: What can I say? It's Gegege no Kitaro. This
obscure one-eyed boy is a mascot on Japanese shores but
still unknown to general public all over the the rest
of the world. The game is a plain and really difficult 
(in many aspects) RPG loaded with traditional Japanese 
puns, religious aspects and surroundings. If you want to
know the basics of what is going on - check another .txt
file in this archive or wikipedia - it's up to you.
As for the game itself - I'd wish you a lot of luck, if
you decided to clear it through. As in any usual oldschool
game you know practically nothing of what to do or go
next. The control system of the game is not that clear 
as well. Just a quick hint: try pressing U or D on the
battle screen to get to some alternatives :)

The game was our first collaboration attempt with Djinn.
He was totally responsible for all the hacking work and
I must admit that his job is just flawless.
The translation was a great challenge for me due to
many cultural and encyclopedic information contained
within the game. And one more - they speak Kansai-ben...
And a lot! So it would be a real nightmare without some
help from a good person listed in the credits. This was
a long way to go but we managed to pass that.

Use a patching IPS utility of your choice to apply the
patch. The game may have some problems with some
emulators but FCEU should work just fine. 

We would be highly grateful, if you find some time to 
contact us with proposals or corrections. The script 
may still look rough in places so your help would 
be really appreciated.     

Enjoy the playing!

Credits go to:
aishsha - who else can praise you than yourself? Well, I was the
one who spoiled the whole script with this translation. 

ASchultz - for his proofreading activities (again!).
Thanks, man ;)

Djinn - for his god-like hacking skills which made translation
activities a pleasant business to deal with.

fuzzball - for his enormous help with Kansai-ben and support all
along (thanks again, man ;)).

All those who contributed into this process.
