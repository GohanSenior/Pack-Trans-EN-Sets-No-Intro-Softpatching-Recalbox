****VERY IMPORTANT****
please take the time to read the section on running nadia.
it contains information on the compatibility of the nadia rom
on the current emulators that are out there!

*Special thanks goes out to Toma XIII
 for helping Anus P. with a few translations
 and to necrosaro for starting the Nadia project
 and devolping great tools to work with.

How much of this game is translated??
Well, as far we know, the whole game's been translated!
Now there may be a few spots that may sound strange, but
that's only because we translated the game from dumped scripts
and we'll try to correct all mis-translated things as soon
as possible!

How can you help:

(1) If there is any untranslated text in the game, please tell us
	and send us screenshots and a savestate/savegame, whatever!

(2) We're not to sure how the credits at the end of the game will turn
	out, so if anybody has any savegames we could use to check
	this out, it woulds be greatly appreaciated!

(3) If there is any instince where its obvious that the wrong text
	gets displayed, please tell us what line gets displayed
	and what it should possibly say.  This is a common error
	when using pointer table modifications for translating
	games.

*Nadia was hacked using the following tools:

	Thingy
	Hex Workshop
	Nesticle

Nadia Updates and releases:

version 1.3

-Added in the menu that said "NO ITEM" when viewing the stats of a
 character who is not holding an Item
-made "NEO ATLANTIS" display when "NEO ATLANTIS WON!" was displayed in the
 close up battles
-Fixed up when you win a close up battle so that the "Kt" after your
 armys name doesn't show up
-Fixed the menu that lets you select letters for entering your name
-changed the item "ELECTRC" into "POWER" to sound better
-changed "BABELTOE" into "BABEL" It should really be Tower of Babel.
 Babel-Toe was a mistranslation but we're keeping it as just "BABEL"
 because Tower wont fit in the maximum space there is for it
-changed some other texts that appear on the battle field to make
 more sense

version 1.2

-As far as we know, everything in this release is translated!
 but we could be wrong.. and we intend to fix a couple things up
 here and there....

version 1.0

-Initial release
-Not much translated... just the main menus and character and Item names
 and stuff.

Applying the IPS patch to the rom:

We recommend you use SNESTOOL to do this for you.  It's by far the easiest
IPS patcher to use!  just load it up, select "USE IPS" and follow
the instructions!

Running nadia:

When running Nadia *DO NOT* use nesticle!
There are times in it where the game tends to lock up!

As of right now, the only 2 emulators which we find are able
to run nadia without it crashing or locking up are fwNES, and
BioNES!

If speed is a problem for you use fwNES, because its the
fastest.  But if speed isn't a problem for you, then
stick with BioNES.  Although it may be slower, the graphics
are displayed correctly!  But this doesn't mean that the
graphics don't turn out bad on fwNES, there's just a few
glitches and layering problems.. nothing serious.

If anyone knows any other emulators which wont lock up
nadia, please tell us so we can give people more
selection to choose from!

How to play Nadia:

well, first of all you gotta use the main menus to start a new game.
First you gotta register a new log before you can actually start playing!
the menu systems fairly straight forward and easy to figure out.
but playing the game is a different story!  It first starts off as your
turn to tell your army what to do.  You can select which guy you want to
something and menu will show up.  This menu will give you the option to
a) Move b)Use a skill c)use an Item d)Veiw the character's stats.
although you might think that moving your characters is pointless, you'll
soon find out that it is almost nessessary to move your characters on the
battle field so that you can get into more strategic positions and also
to get your army onto the offensive rather than defensive!  if you move
one of your characters beside one of the enemies characters an RPG-style
battle will break out!  When this happens you will have the option to
a)Fight b)use a Skill c)use an Item d)RUN!!  fairly straigh forward to
figure out I would think.  Oh, and choosing skill will allow you to use a
special technique or choosing Item will allow you to use an Item!
experiment to see which does which!  That's pretty much the whole game right
there!  oh, I nearly forgot, to win a battle, all you have to do is kill
the enemies Emperor, but beware, you will loose as soon as Nadia is killed,
so choose your fights wisely!

One last thing you could do if you want to help is submit a better guide
for playing the game.  If anybody wants to do that, it would be great!
