-------------------------------- INTRODUCTION ---------------------------------

Kaiketsu Yanchamaru 3 - Taiketsu! Zouringen is an action game released by IREM
for the Famicom game system in 1993. It was never officially translated into
English but was translated by Suicidal Translations and released under the name
Kid Niki 3 on February 28th, 2003.

This file serves as an instruction manual for the translated game. It is not a
translation of the original instruction manual but is an original work based on
my experiences playing the game.

---------------------------------- THE STORY ----------------------------------

You play as Kid Niki, ninja extraordinaire, who must rescue Princess Kurumi
from the evil Stone Wizard. Niki must battle through 6 levels of hell in order
to face his mortal enemy in a final showdown for the princess' very soul.

---------------------------------- GAMEPLAY -----------------------------------

This is a basic NES action game, so gameplay isn't exceptionally difficult.
There are no options, you just press start from the title screen and are thrown
into the fray.

General play control is as such:

Left/Right: move left/right
      Down: squat
        Up: stab your staff up
         B: swing your staff / swim / row
         A: jump
     Start: pause
  A + Down: power slide
  B + Down: bounce on staff

Additionally. holding down A will cause you to blink. If you're standing still
when you release A, you will spin around on your staff, hitting enemies from
all directions. If you're walking when you release A, you'll jump higher and
farther than you normally do. 

Stabbing your staff into a wall and releasing the B button while pushing toward
the wall will allow you to springboard in the other direction.


LEVELS
------

Level One: Much like the original, Niki's adventure begins in a lush, green
valley. He must fight his way through enemies such as gas mask wearing ninjas in
stocking caps, gas mask wearing robots without stocking caps and walking
shuriken. At the end of the valley is a massive fortress containing fire spewing
wells. The boss of this level is a fire demon dressed like MC Hammer.

Level Two: Next, Niki's great quest takes him to the sea side which is populated
by the most disturbing statues ever seen in an NES game. They're so disturbing
that I can't even think of another adjective to  apply to them, nor will I
relive the horrid nightmares caused by them by attempting to describe them. In
this level, Niki alternates between hopping from island to island and swimming
underwater, while battling the aforementioned statues, rabid sharks,
non-exploding mines and a duck that pukes fish at you. Ruling this bizarre stage
is what can best be described as an Aquaman fanboy who's into hip hop fashion.

Level 3: Onward Niki journies, this time to the mountains where he must first
scale a waterfall and then the mountain itself. If you thought the earier
enemies were strange, wait until you get a load of dogs made out of ink bottles
and match sticks, gun toting flowers and leg shaped turnips. In charge of this
level is a living tree who seems to prefer gladiator-wear over the previous hip
hop clothing.

Level 4: Next, our hero travels across an arid desert and into the sky itself
where he's thwarted by the fans that make wind! Opposing Niki are bats, bees
and gun toting armadillos. Hop from cloud in search of the boss, a ninja wit a
bell... and he rings it at you! Evil incarnate, I tell you!

Level 5: Niki's trek through the clouds has brought him to the moon, which is
frozen solid. The moon base is guarded by ninjas on ice skates (which explains
the stocking caps from the first level), missile ice cream cones, mice in 
refrigerators and what appears to be a pissed off tea kettle but I don't intend
to pause it long enough to make sure. The leader of the moonbase is a hot chick
in ice skates. She's even dressed appropriately.. at least if you consider that
it's deemed appropriate for women to wear skimpy skirts while ice skating.

Level 6: You know you're getting close to the end when you hit the robot
factory! Niki must battle hordes of evil robots in the largest level yet. In one
bizarre scenario, Niki questions his sexuality as he battles a pink clad clone
of himself. (Perhaps this is brought on by beating up the girl in the last
level?) This level's boss is the hooded bastard who helped the Stone Wizard
capture Princess Kurumi! (He might be the main boss from Kid Niki 2, I don't
remember.)

Level 7: Here it is, the Zaiketsu! Zouringen. Er.. I mean, the showdown with
the Stone Wizard. Dodge the Wizard's Niki-seeking sperm (what's with the sudden
homosexual overtones?) and whack him with your staff, grabbing hearts when you
can and avoiding the spikes at all costs. Once you've depleted Stone Wizard's
energy, he'll run away, only to return for the final battle....


ITEMS
-----

Pita Bread - Gather 20 of these each level to play the bonus game.

BONUS GAME
----- ----

If you gather 20 pitas in a single level, you'll have a chance to win a bonus
item for the next level. Pop 3 balloons. If all 3 match, you win! If they don't,
you get points as a consolation prize. 3 Niki heads will give you a power boost
for the next level, 3 Kurumi heads will give you a defensive boost.

---------------------------------- CONCLUSION ---------------------------------

So there you have it. Not the most complex game of all time but I rather enjoy
it. It won't take you hours on end to defeat like some other games but it's
well worth playing when you're just out to have a little fun.
