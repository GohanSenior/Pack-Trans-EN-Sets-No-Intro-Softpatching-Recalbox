1.About Recca
-------------
Recca is the most insane shooter I've ever played for
the NES. This is QUALITY, people. It's fast, it's furious,
it's bloody difficult, because by the time you see something
and move to react to it, it's already killed you :D This game
is GREAT! It also looks as if it was originally based on the
Dezaemon FC engine; it perhaps originated as a contest entry
of some sort. A few of the enemy graphics are similar, powerup
progression behaves the same way, it starts out with that
launch-off-the-platform thing that Dezaemon has.

Oh well, whatever.

2.Patch History
---------------
The project started and ended on December 2, 2002.
It originated out of a need to release something on
the following Wednesday, and out of a need for this
awesome game to get -some- recognition. It's a quick
and dirty title hack, nothing more.

December 4, 2002 - Initial version 1.00 Release
