How much of this game is translated??
Well, as far we know, the whole game's been translated!
Now there may be a few spots that may sound strange, but
that's only because we translated the game from dumped scripts
(context may be wrong in many cases) and we'll try to correct
all mis-translated things as soon as possible!

How can you help:

(1) If there is any untranslated text in the game, please tell us
	and send us screenshots and a savestate/savegame, whatever!

(2) We've only beta tested part way through the game, so if anybody
        has any savegames we could use to check out the end of the
        game, it would be greatly appreciated!

(3) If there is any instance where its obvious that the wrong text
	gets displayed, please tell us what line gets displayed
	and what it should possibly say.  This is a common error
	when using pointer table modifications for translating
        games, and when translating based on script dumps.

*STED was hacked using the following tools:

        Thingy
        Tile Layer
        Nesticle

STED Updates and releases:

version 1.0

-Initial release
-Everything we could find has been translated! Have fun!

Applying the IPS patch to the rom:

We recommend you use SNESTOOL to do this for you.  It's by far the easiest
IPS patcher to use!  just load it up, select "USE IPS" and follow
the instructions!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Running STED:

As far as I know, STED should run on any NES emulator with good
compatibility, like NESticle, BioNES, FWNES, LoopyNES, etc.
Due to the speed at which the game plays (and the limited amount of time
we all have nowadays), I would suggest increasing the frameskip, or you
will probably get bored of all of the long pauses and delays, like i did :)
