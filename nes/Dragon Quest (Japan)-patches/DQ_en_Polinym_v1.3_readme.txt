	This translation was created with care by me, Polinym.  Thanks
for downloading it and supporting my work! I hope you enjoy playing through
the original Dragon Quest!

	 Included with the original patch is a hack that's exactly
the same, only all enemies drop 255 experience and large amounts of Gold upon
their defeat. This way, you have the option of skipping the hours of grinding and
just seeing all the original game has to offer.

	Curious what I decided to do with the localization choices I love like
Erdrick, Dragonlord, Gwaelin, and all that? You'll have to play the game for yourself!

	If you encounter any bugs that I didn't catch, paticularly those that make
the game unplayable (the game should be 100% playable. I beat it myself twice), please
don't hesitate to let me know! I'd perfer you just send me a PM through the ROMHacking.net
forums so I can fix the issue right away.

	Revision 1.1 - Fixed the typo "recieves" to "receives".

	Revision 1.2 - Fixed typo ("Lailho" -> Laliho), lali!
		    - Fixed text overflow error.
	Revision 1.3 - Solved password issue once and for all.
