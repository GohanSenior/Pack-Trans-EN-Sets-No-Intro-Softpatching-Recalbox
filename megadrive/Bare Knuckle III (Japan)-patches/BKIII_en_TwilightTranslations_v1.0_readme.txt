1. Introduction

--------------------------------------

Released on March 3, 1994, Bare Knuckle 3 (or Streets of Rage 3 as it came to be known
outside Japan) is the third and final entry in the classic beat'em up Mega Drive series
Bare Knuckle.

When BK3 was translated and released as Streets of Rage 3, Sega -- for whatever
reason -- significantly altered the content of the game. The most obvious change was
the story, or lack thereof. The entire introduction sequence was removed along with
other scenes in the game. In addition to this, the difficulty in SoR3 was ramped up to
insane levels, making SoR3's hard mode comparable to BK3's Very Hard mode. However, the
most perplexing change was the characters' palettes. Instead of wearing his usual
white T-shirt and blue jeans, Axel was sporting jet black pants and a yellow shirt,
reminiscent of Adam's attire. The other characters suffered similar "improvements."

The full list of changes made is well-documented and can be easily found online,
so I won't dwell on the negative any further. What we have instead is a game that is
a deserving successor to the Bare Knuckle/Streets of Rage legacy. This is hands down one
of the greatest beat'em ups released during the era.

2. Development

--------------------------------------

I'll be honest. Streets of Rage 2 is probably my hands-down favorite game of all time.
I can't tell you how many hours of my youth were spent playing that game. So my interest
in BK3 probably stems from there.

The exact date I began working on BK3 with the intention to translate it isn't very clear,
but the oldest file and emails related to this date back to early May 2006. Yeah, this
project's been going on for a long time. I remember vaguely how it began, though. A group
of hackers by the name of g8z_et_al (AKA z80_gaiden AKA Guest) had posted on RHDN concerning
a Mega Drive game. Once I expressed my interest in BK3, they sent me a build of their modded
version of Gens and the location of the Japanese font.

So, I spent a few days (or weeks; I'm not sure) studying the code to make sure that I was
even capable of hacking a Mega Drive game. All of my experience up to this point had been on
the NES and SNES and the MD was entirely different beast. In retrospect, I'm actually kind
of surprised that I didn't give up on the game. Anyway, I wrote a custom dumper and
extracted the script. Then I contacted Anton Berglin, who had written a translation of
BK3's text for Streets of Rage Online. He worked on it for a few months and finally sent
me the script back around late November 2006. That's where the long period of uncertainty
began.

I'd like to think I produce only quality translations. To me, that typically means using a
Variable Width-Font (VWF) where necessary and ensuring the script looks and sounds good in
English. Both of these were necessary for BK3, but the former would prove much more
difficult to implement than the latter. You see, I had no ASM experience with the MD or any
68000-based system, nor was there a suitable 68k assembler available. No, if I wanted the
game to have a VWF I would have to make the assembler myself. Enter SEKAS.

SEKAS (short for Sixty Eight K ASsembler) is a modified version of byuu's excellent xkas
with support added for the 68k processor (obviously). Creating SEKAS and testing it took
easily a year of my life. I restarted the project twice that I know of, but I'm almost
certain the current build is the result of a third reboot. The first versions were the
results of my attempting to write an assembler from scratch, on my own. The final version
was a result of working directly with xkas's source code. There are still a few bugs in
SEKAS, which I discovered while working a demo of my own. Once these are fixed, I intend
to release SEKAS.

That puts us at late 2007 (work on SEKAS began in early December 2006) when work on BK3
could finally resume. Due to lack of time and debugging Live-A-Live (another patch that
I am extremely proud of) for Aeon Genesis, I don't think I started working on the VWF for
BK3 until about February 2008. Once work finally began, it only took a month or so to get
the VWF up and running perfectly. That left only the script editing.

A fellow by the name of Valkyrie_Ace (AKA Roy_Fokker) volunteered to edit the script in
early March 2008. Unfortunately, real life got in the way and it took VA until early
November to get the first draft of the script back to me. I hooked back up with Anton
to look over the script and let him voice any of his concerns...and that's the last I heard
from either of them. I'm not sure what happened. Alas. Hoping they would resurface to finish
the script, I let the first draft sit on my harddrive until early January 2009 when I
decided I would finish the editing myself. And that brings us to today.

Beta testing is in progress as I type this. Sliver X has run through the game and has only
found two typos. Christuserloser is running through the game with his flashcart to ensure
there are no problems with the various platforms he has access to. I ran through the game
earlier on my model 2 Genesis with no problems.

In closing, I'd just like to say that I hope you all enjoy this patch. This project in some
form or another has been a huge part of my life for the past 3 years, and I'm almost sad to
see it come to an end. Fortunately my happiness overshadows my sadness. Grab a buddy and
enjoy some old school beat'em up action on me.

3. Notes

--------------------------------------

If you've followed along with this project, you'll know that I've contemplated releasing two
patches: one using the original Bare Knuckle 3 names and another using the Streets of Rage 3
names (Skate instead of Sammy, Roo, not Victy, etc) and title screen. In the end I decided
against this for two reason. First, importing the title screen is a significant amount of work
that I don't want to do. Second, where do I draw the line on the names? Only player characters
or do I change the enemy names too to be consistent with SoR1 and SoR2? I couldn't come up with
an answer, so I've chosen to release only one patch. Besides, now when the pirates sell RARE L@@K
copies of ENGLISH BARE KNUCKLE 3 on eBay, I'll know exactly how much money someone has made off of my work.

4. Patch History

--------------------------------------

-Version 1.00

 All the text in the game has been translated. This includes both dialogue in the story mode
 and the win/lose quotes in the Battle mode, and the Engrish in the battle mode has been fixed.
 The patch has been thoroughly tested and works on the hardware. If you find a platform it
 doesn't work on, let me know.

 Included files:

 *bk3_100.ips - The English translation.

 Overall, I'm extremely happy with the quality of the patch. This is probably the cleanest
 code I've ever hacked into a game. Everything about this patch was fun to do, and hopefully
 that shows.
 
 There are currently no known bugs. Please note, however, that the patch has only been tested
 on an American Sega Genesis Model 2. The code has been written in such a way that it should
 work on all models, though.

In addition to the people listed in the Credits section, a few people deserve a special
mention, without whom, this project would never have been completed:

* g8z_et_al	- You guys have helped me so much. Without you I probably wouldn't be the hacker
		  I am today. I hope you know how much I appreciate it!

* Suzaku	- A partner in crime and more importantly a friend, who's helped out with on
		  the spot translations and editing advice.

* The fans	- The encouragement from members of various online communities (Sega-16, Streets
		  of Rage Remake, Streets of Rage Online, and more) has been overwhelmingly
		  positive even in the project's darkest hours. The praise and doubt kept me
		  going. Thanks guys.
		  
And lastly all the people whose names I've forgotten. Thank you very much.
