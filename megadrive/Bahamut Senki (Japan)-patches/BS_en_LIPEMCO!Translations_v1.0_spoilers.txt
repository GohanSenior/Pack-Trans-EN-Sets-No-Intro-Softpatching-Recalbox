You may have noticed that the manual makes mention of Ell Moir's sister Ell 
Wynn, and even includes artwork of her, but she does not appear to be playable 
in the game. Well, she's actually a hidden character. When "Press Start Button" 
is flashing on the title screen, press the A Button three times, then press 
Start followed by C to begin a new game. (Follow these instructions exactly. 
This code will not work you move the cursor on the main menu before selecting 
"New Game", or if you enter the code after opening the main menu and backing out 
of it with B.)

If done correctly, the game setup screen's background will be pink instead of 
black and the "monster" that presents it will be replaced by a woman. Ell Moir 
will then be replaced by Ell Wynn as both a playable character and a CPU 
opponent. Though she shares her units, starting areas, and so on with Ell Moir, 
Ell Wynn has different stats and abilities.

                    *       Secret Programmer Credit       *
                    ****************************************

This one was discovered by Mega Drive wizard andlabs years ago and is already 
well documented, but it's included here for completeness' sake. After winning 
the game under any configuration that would achieve a standard ending (with the 
staff roll), hold A, C, and Down simultaneously as the game starts the ending. 
All three buttons must be held at the moment the game begins fading in to the 
image of Bahamut; start holding them as soon as you've met a victory condition 
to be safe.

If done correctly, the programmer's pseudonym in the credits, "Moomin", will be 
replaced by his real name: Kenichi Kuratani.

Note that this can't be done in Spectator Mode because it doesn't show the 
endings.

                    *             True Ending              *
                    ****************************************

Rather unusually for a strategy game whose plot normally consists almost 
entirely of backstory found only in the manual, Bahamut Senki actually has one 
true ending. It's accessible only by playing the game in a very, very, _very_ 
specific way. There is absolutely no information in the game or the manual that 
would lead you to do any of this; again, this game had an official strategy 
guide and they needed a way to sell it.

Here are the steps to follow to get the true ending:

  1. Start the game under Advanced Rules on scenario "The Bloodthirsty Bahamut" 
as Sieg. Any difficulty level is fine.

  2. Play until Turn 15 with Balmer, Klimt, and Vastral still alive.

  3. Agree to Raymond's request to go on a journey to defeat Balmer alone; he 
will do so after a few turns. Make sure no one else kills Balmer before this 
happens.

  4. Play until Turn 40, leaving Klimt and Vastral alive.

  5. Agree to Raymond's request to fight as a Hero.

  6. Assign Raymond to a squadron and send him into battle against Klimt; in 
this battle, you need to get Raymond's squadron killed directly by Klimt 
himself. If you did it correctly, you'll get a special message from Raymond at 
the start of the next turn after the battle.

     As a tip here: Raymond is absurdly overpowered, so the easiest thing here 
is to assign him to a Holy Warrior squadron and just send him alone into battle, 
regardless of how many troops Klimt has with him. Klimt's demons are basically 
incapable of dealing anything beyond chip damage to Raymond, so use Raymond's 
magic to keep him healed and the enemy will basically just run up to him and get 
killed by his counterattacks. Once everyone except Klimt is dead, take him on in 
single combat and lose on purpose.

  7. Defeat all remaining Masters except for Vastral.

  8. Have Sieg, and only Sieg, Invade the area where Vastral is.

If done correctly, rather than the Tactical Screen, you'll get the true ending.
