***********
INTROUCTION
***********
This is an adventure game by Namco based on the Nadia anime by GAINAX.

The script was translated by Eien Ni Hen in 2009, and I have hacked it.
It was a learning experience as my first MD/Genesis translation hack.

WHAT'S DONE
***********
 Should be complete.

************
WHAT'S BUGGY
************
 Only issue is a couple screens I'm not sure how they'd look on hardware.
 Looks fine on Kega Fusion, corrupt on Gens Tracer.

*********************
PATCHING INSTRUCTIONS
*********************
 Either apply the IPS version of the patch to a Nadia ROM.
 Hopefully you all know to make sure to apply it to a de-interleaved version
 (most commonly known as a "BIN" ROM) and NOT the interleaved "SMD" format.
 or use a program such as upset (from byuu.org) to apply the UPS version.

****************
EMULATION ISSUES
****************
 As with bugs, a couple intro screens are glitched in Gens Tracer, looks fine in Fusion.
 Don't know which is accurate to hardware.

*****************
PLAY INSTRUCTIONS
*****************
 Set your console region to USA to play the game in English.

 At the "Namco For Sega Genesis" screen, press A to play the intro
 or Start to skip to the title sequence.
 Press Start again to go to the start menu.

 Choose BEGIN to start a new game, PASSWORD to continue a previous game,
 or SOUND MENU to listen to the game's soundtrack.

 On the password screen, use the D-Pad to choose a letter, A to input the letter.
 Press B to erase a letter and move the input cursor back,
 press C to erase forward. Press Start when finished.
 Note that due to programming limitations, the original Japanese passwords won't work
 in the dual-language patch.
 If you know the English passwords, they should work if you enter the
 characters in the same positions.

 During the game, use the D-Pad to move, A to search objects or talk to people and
 C to open the command menu.
 Press C to enter choices and B to cancel.

 Watch the story scenes, then in the exploration scenes go around and use the items to solve puzzles.

 Commands:
 Items : Use or look at items.
   Use : Use an item.
   Give : Give an item to another character. Some characters can't give away an item, and others can
     only be used by the right person.
   Look : Look at the item, maybe it will give you a clue.
 Move : Quickly go to another scene of the level. Too bad it seems to only be used in the first chapter.
 Talk : Have Jean speak to another character.
