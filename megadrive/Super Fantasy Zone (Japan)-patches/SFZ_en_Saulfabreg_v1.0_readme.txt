ENGLISH translation v1.0

by saulfabreg (c) 2021

With this "translation" patch you can play the game "Super Fantasy Zone" for
Sega Genesis / Sega Mega Drive in English (only text and menus are in English).

There are two patches: "superfzone-J-EN-v1.0.bps", which is for use with the
original Japanese ROM file of the game, and "superfzone-U-GenMini-EN-v1.0.bps",
which is for use with the "American" (USA) Genesis Mini / Mega Drive Mini ROM dump
of the Japanese game.
These ROMs must be in ".bin" format. It also works in ROMs that are in ".md" format.

---
The patches must be applied in the following roms:
---

Patch file: superfzone-J-EN-v1.0.bps
Rom name: Super Fantasy Zone (Japan).md
CRC32: 767780D7

---

Patch file: superfzone-U-GenMini-EN-v1.0.bps
Rom name: Super Fantasy Zone (USA) (Ja) (Genesis Mini).md
CRC32: D97D913D

OTHER NOTES:

The game has not been translated, the Japanese version of the game has the English
language hidden, it is curious that they did not activate it in the Mega Drive version,
but by modifying the "region" of the ROM file from 'Japan' to 'USA'
internally in a hex editor it was possible to have the game in English following
a "region change" tutorial from a random user in Reddit "r/MegaDrive".

Now, this translation is now in patch form to make it easier for you.

The European version was launched in English, but it runs slow (PAL50 / 50Hz),
so I decided to have the English version of the game in real full speed, so I
found that the "English" hidden language of the Japanese version will
also run in NTSC / 60Hz.

Enjoy this patch!! :)
