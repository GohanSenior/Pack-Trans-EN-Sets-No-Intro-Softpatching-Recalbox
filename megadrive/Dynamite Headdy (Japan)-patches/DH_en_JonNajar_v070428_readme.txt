                         English Translation Patch




 History
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

070428 Initial release




 Overview
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a translation patch for the Mega Drive game "Dynamite Headdy".
It sports a variable-width font engine with kerning support and, as usual,
it is a "dual-language" patch, meaning that it supports both Japanese and
English, depending on the country code of your machine.




 Applying the Patch
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hopefully included with this document is a patch file in the IPS format.
You can use any program that supports that file format to apply this
translation patch to your ROM file.




 Playing the Game
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you've patched the ROM file, simply load it up in your favorite
Genesis / Mega Drive emulator, console copier, or flash cartridge.

The game will detect the country code of your machine (real or emulated) and
then switch to English or Japanese mode accordingly. This permits you to play
the game in the original Japanese, if you so desire.




 Q & A
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: This patch doesn't work! What do I do?

A: Make sure that your ROM file is not in an interleaved format. It's also
   possible that there is more than one version of the game, or that your
   copy is corrupt.

   If you are using a different patching program, please make sure that the
   ROM file you are patching is the official Japanese version, not the
   English or beta version, and that it has not been modified or corrupted.


Q: It doesn't work with my copier / flash cartridge! Why not?

   This was tested on a real Genesis so you shouldn't have any problems in
   that respect. The most likely reason is that something went wrong during
   the patching process. See the previous question and try it in an emulator
   to see if that works.


Q: Why is the text in Japanese?!?

A: This is a dual-language translation patch. If it detects that it is
   running on a Japanese system, it will use the original game script.
   If you are using an emulator, make sure the country code is set to USA.


Q: Why does my emulator/tool say the checksum is bad?

A: This game uses a non-standard method to calculate the checksum.
   If the checksum really is bad, you'll get the "red screen of death".


Q: Were there any textual differences in the beta version of this game?

A: No, except that the beta script was shorter.
