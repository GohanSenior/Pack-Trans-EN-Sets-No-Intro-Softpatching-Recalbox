6. What is translated:

- Everything aside from character voices (played during visions) and the lyrics for the song "Sign of a Hero". For the former, each voice sample is accompanied by a speech bubble containing the written-out lines (which we translated).

---

7. Localized puns:

- During one cutscene in World 2, while looking through a treasure deposit, Guntz finds a few guns that allow him to learn his first special move, Shinigami Fire. In the same cutscene, Klonoa finds another treasure that Karal says is called Chirigami (Tissue) Fire, used for blowing one's nose. Because we ended up translating Guntz's move name to Death God Fire, we had to change this pun to match; Klonoa now finds a bottle of what Karal calls Breath God Fire, a type of mouthwash.

- At one point in the Sky Temple, Klonoa's impressed that Pango has a silver medal (ranked higher than his and Guntz's medals), and asks if he can admire the pangolin. Pango responds that no admiration was necessary, making a dad-joke out of it. This pun's a bit harder to explain in English, but basically:
-- "Sonkei" = admiration
-- "Son na koto nai" = not really
-- What Pango said here is: "Sonke koto nai" (a corruption of the two phrases). Because this corruption couldn't be translated well into English, we ended up swapping it out with a different kind of dad-joke. Basically, Klonoa just says he's amazed, and Pango replies "Hi 'Amazed', I'm Pango!"

---

8. Profanity Warning:

We're aware that Japanese profanity works differently from English profanity. However, in order to convey the effect of the original dialogue, and to avoid making players feel like we watered it down, we decided to use equivalent English profanity (including two instances of the F bomb, both from Guntz) in our translations, with the assumption that we're going for a Teen ESRB rating. Because of this, playerâ€™s discretion is advised, especially for younger fans of the Klonoa series.

10. SRAM patch troubleshooting

If you find that your ROM will not work on your desired hardware after installing our SRAM patch, please follow these steps below:

- Download the GBATA tool (https://no-intro.org/tools.htm)
- After patching your Japanese Klonoa Heroes ROM using the non-SRAM patch, use the GBATA tool's SRAM patcher to patch your game
- When selecting the patched ROM you just created, remember to manually change the save type to SRAM in the ROM's settings (the method to do this may vary depending on what flash cart you're using)

A video test of this method can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f07FtkCul5A

11. 3DS Troubleshooting

If you find that the SRAM-patched ROM will not work on 3DS after converting it to a cia file and injecting it, please follow these steps below:

- Turn off your Nintendo 3DS
- While holding the SELECT button, turn on your 3DS
- Keep holding SELECT until you see the Luma configuration menu
- Make sure the "Show GBA boot screen in patched AGB_FIRM" option is turned off (there will be no x in the parenthesis to the left of the option)
- Press START to save your changes and return to the HOME menu
