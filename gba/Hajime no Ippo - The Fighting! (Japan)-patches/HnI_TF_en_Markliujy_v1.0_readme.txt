                      English Translation Patch
                                v1.0

  Intro
----------------------------------------------------------------

This is an English patch for the GBA game "Hajime no Ippo",
a boxing game that is apparently like Punch Out, but with
Hajime no Ippo characters.


 The Patch
----------------------------------------------------------------

The Patch is in IPS format and can be applied using any
program that supports the format. If you don't know of one,
try googling LunarIPS.

The Patch is made to be applied to the version of the ROM
found on the internet, namely:

CRC32:  0x6EB8B128
Size:   8.00 MB (8,388,608 bytes)
Contains an Eurasia Intro

The Patch will translate the entire game into English, and
will also remove the Eurasia Intro.

It has not been tested on any other versions.


 Translation Notes
----------------------------------------------------------------

1) Move Names:

 - I used "Long Upper", and it seemed to fit, but I'm not
    certain about it.

 - "Get Up" means that literally, you get up. I couldn't
    think of any fancy way of saying it that was under the
    letter limit.

 - "Automatic Evade" means that literally to, you
    automatically evade. It's technically the "SP-DEF", or
    Special Defence that shows up on the screen when you're
    actually boxing. Again, I couldn't think of any cool way
    of phrasing it.

 - "Damage Avoid" is Date's special head turning move, the
    only special Special Defence. Again, I had no cool ideas.

 - "Down Avoid" is Down Avoid. You avoid going down. Since
    it was "D-Avoid", I figured it'd be better off that way.

 - "Is that all you got?" is Shigeta's trademark taunt from
    the manga and anime, if you don't know the manga and anime,
    it's a taunt, which is what its under in the Move lists due
    to laziness.

2) Move Lists:

 - There was a line of Japanese in the move lists that I
    removed, since I had no idea what it meant, except that it
    mentioned "button". Probably just telling you that you hit
    the buttons. I'm guessing no one needs to know that
    hopefully.

 - For the Counter moves, "When Attacked" doesn't actually
    literally mean when attacked, as I'm sure you'll figure out.

3) Misc:
 - The title screen is left in Japanese due to it looking
    better that way, and laziness.
 - In case the font looks familiar, I used Arial a lot (Lazy).


 Other Notes
----------------------------------------------------------------

This is my first attempt at Romhacking, but the game
"should" be completely translated, apart from the sound
and have no problems.

However, there wasn't exactly any play testing, except
myself playing through it once or twice. So, if anything is
omitted or incorrect, please contact me. Any technical
hiccup reports would be nice too.

 Rant (Or History)
----------------------------------------------------------------

 - This is my first actual complete romhacking project.

 - I started it back in April or so of 2008, thinking it
would be a nice game to try and finish up since I *thought*
it was all entirely composed of uncompressed graphics. I was
wrong.

 - The game contained LZ compressed data and I was lost for
a bit, but eventually wrote up decompressors and the like,
in PHP. That was quite entertaining.

 - After a whole bunch of stumbling around and false starts,
I eventually got somewhere after a month or so of on and off
hacking.

 - Then I got lazy. Lack of translations and lots of manual
labour is sure a killer...

 - Eventually I got back to it and finished up, except for
the Win Quotes, because well, they don't run well through an
online translator.

 - Thanks to BRPXQZME of Romhacking.net I got the rest of
the Win Quotes translated, and here I am.
