Tomato Adventure - English Localization (v1.1.1)
================================================

This is an unofficial translation of Tomato Adventure, a Japanese RPG released
in 2002 on the Game Boy Advance.  Tomato Adventure was developed by AlphaDream
and involved some staff from Super Mario RPG.

Please support continued development of quality games like Tomato Adventure by
buying copies of the game, games in the Mario & Luigi series, and other RPGs.


Patching instructions
---------------------

This patch is intended to be used on a ROM image of Tomato Adventure, which is
not included.  Please use a backup of your own legally purchased game for this
purpose.  As of writing, the game is still available to purchase online.

Once you have the image, please use this tool to apply the patch:
https://www.romhacking.net/patch/

Select your backup image in the ROM file field, then select the provided patch
named "Tomato Adventure [en-us 1.1.1].bps" in the Patch file field.

The "update" folder contains additional patch files for use on ROM images that
have older versions of this patch applied.  Select the patch file that matches
your previous version for the Patch file field, instead.

The tool will then validate your backup image's CRC32 checksum.  If it detects
an issue, please make a fresh backup of your game and try again.

Once ready, click Apply patch to save the patched ROM image.  You may use this
in a Game Boy Advance emulator such as mGBA or no$gba, or use a device to play
it on your physical GBA.
