Hi! Thank you for dowloading this translation patch. 
Although it is not entirely complete, it is the most complete and accurate english translation out there.
This patch should currently has all non-graphic text translated. If you see any non-menu text untranslated, please let me know.
Read the changelog for more specific info.

How to use:

2. Find a .ups patcher (Preferably NUPS) 
3. Patch the .ups file onto the original ROM.
4. Play the game.

Thank you to Nebelwurfe. Without his text-editing tool, my translation wouldn't have been possible.
