Translation for Fire Emblem 6: Fuuin No Tsurugi
Done by Dark Twilkitri Net Translation Division

People hoped for years that Nintendo would deign to release Fire Emblem 6 Fuuin No Tsurugi (FE6) on shores outside of Japan.

They didn't.

it's up to us to take matters into our own hands.

Installing the Fire Emblem 6 IPS patch.
---

Windows Users - 
Go on a search engine and locate IPSWin.

HOW TO USE IPSWIN
Simply select a file to patch and a valid IPS file to patch it. Click on Patch! Button and enjoy the progress dialog box!
The program will notify you when the patching completes.
The option "Backup Copy" will create a backup of your file.
Keep in mind that even if IPSWin is generally able to recover your original files if the patching goes wrong,
it's highly raccomended to make a backup copy just to be sure...
"Log File" can help to find some malfunction either
in the IPS file or in the program. 


Autopatching(Visual Boy Advance)

example;
if your Fire Emblem 6 ROM is named FE6.GBA
and you downloaded the patch
Place both in the same directory
and rename them so that their names are identical

FE6.GBA
FE6.IPS

And simply run FE6.GBA in Visual Boy Advance and it will automatically patch!
If it does not, try checking under the Options/Tools menus to see if Autopatching for IPS is enabled.
