Thank you for viewing the English translation patch for Neon Genesis Evangelion: Shito Ikusei, created by the Anime Game Translations Team!

Before you can play the translation, you'll need to patch the game on your computer using a legal copy of the ROM.

Instructions

We have included two versions of the patch, as an .ips and a .xdelta file, so you may choose your preferred patching method. You only need to apply ONE patch.

=IPS Patch=
-Before getting started, it is advisable to create a backup of your ROM first, as this method will overwrite the file.
-Download Lunar IPS from https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/240/
-Extract the file, and run Lunar IPS
-Click 'Apply IPS Patch' and choose the 'ShitoPatch.ips' file. Then, when prompted to select a file to patch, choose your copy of the ROM, which should be a '.ws' filetype. If it does not appear in the Lunar IPS selection window, try changing the file type filter from 'Most Common ROM Files' to 'All Files'.
-Click open, and you're good to go!

=xdelta Patch=
-Download DeltaPatcher from https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/704/
-Extract the file, and run either DeltaPatcher or DeltaPatcherLite
-'Original file' should be your copy of the ROM, as an '.ws' filetype.
-For 'XDelta patch', choose the 'ShitoPatch.xdelta' file.
-Hit apply patch, and you're good to go!
*Note that this will overwrite your original file. If you’d like to keep a copy of it instead, change the settings by clicking the cog icon, and tick “Backup original file”. This will create a new ‘--PATCHED.ws’ file instead.

---

Play this file on an emulator such as Oswan, or use a flashcart to play it on any member of the WonderSwan family.

We hope you enjoy!
