Digimon Adventure 02: Tag Tamers
Version 1.4.5

==================================================
|Description
=================================================

In the second season of Digimon, we see a brief flashback of how Ken Ichijouji became the cruel Digimon Emperor.
Like several other parts of Season 2, they didn't elaborate any further on it. Fortunately, a series of games
were released that gave the full story, in ways that are both confirmed and contradicted by the show itself.

*Unfortunately* these games came out on the WonderSwan, which never left the islands of Japan, so English speaking fans
missed out on the adventures of Ken and and the game's hero Ryo Akiyama... until now!

Years in the making, this is my largest project to date. In addition to the translation itself, screen layouts and the game's code 
have been altered to better accommodate the longer English names. Several visual glitches from the original game have also been fixed to improve the experience.

Get ready to purify evil Digimon, fuse your Digimon partners together for more power (seriously, you'll be doing that a lot), and save TWO Digital Worlds!
Now you have the opportunity to ponder the question that has stumped fans for over 20 years:
How does the timeline between the games, the anime, and the movie even work!?

|Frequently Asked Questions
=================================================

Q. How do I buy items at the Geckomon/Otamamon Shop?
-> A. By earning Gold BITs, of course!

Q. ...Okay, how do I earn Gold BITs?
-> A. By battling other players using the link feature on your Wonderswan!
      ...since this is extremely unlikely for most people playing this, I've added code that gives you one Gold BIT per battle. I may tweak this a little in future updates.

      (You can also edit the value using a debugger or in a save state)
       -Mednafen: Open the debug tool, go to 1436C - 1436F in memory, then write your hex value in reverse order
               (So, if you wanted 6160 Gold BITs, you'd convert to 0x1801 then write 01 18)

       -Oswan: Open the save state in a hex editor, go to 143B6 - 143B9, and write your 
               hex value in reverse order
               (So, if you wanted 6160 Gold BITs, you'd convert to 0x1801 then write 01 18)

Q. What are those symbols that appear when I walk over tiles in the DigiCaves?
-> A. That is the English version of DigiCode/Digimoji. I've included a translation guide in the patch's zip file.

Q. You used the names from the Dub? WHY!?
-> A. Because I am history's greatest monster.
      Also, the dub names are what I'm familiar with - it's how I was introduced to Digimon, so it's what came to mind
      when I was writing the dialogue. 

Q. Are you going to release a version using the original Japanese names?
-> A. Probably not any time soon. My current program was built haphazardly, so making that big
      of a change would take a lot of effort.
      My plan is to create a new translation toolkit that will let me edit all the Wonderswan games
      more easily than I can right now, but that will take time.

      That said, if you *really* want a sub version of the patch sooner, I'd be happy to give you the scripts.
      You can fix all the names, send it back to me, and I'll import it into my (eventual) new translation
      program to create a second version of the patch.

Q. Can you make the game in color? What about a Variable Width Font?
-> A. Both of those things are way beyond my current skill-set. 
      If I ever learn how (or if someone wants to teach me), then maybe!

   but I'll try to get it fixed for the next one.
